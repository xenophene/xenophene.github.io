They offered no plan to meet the expense but suggested that the money could be raised by limiting the growth of Medicare and Medicaid and by other savings that could be worked out later with Congress. Growing Public Interest</p><p>Asked how he would pay for the program, Mr. Bush replied, "We'll figure that out."</p><p>As a practical matter, Mr. Bush's program has little chance of becoming law because the Democrats who control Congress favor more ambitious approaches to health care. But his entrance into the debate over a topic that has generated a great deal of interest increases the likelihood that some health insurance plan will be enacted in the next few years.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-first-para--></div><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ln-ctr-top" style="" class="mod-nytimesline mod-line"><!-- Module starts: ln-ctr-top (Line) --><center><div style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc; height:1px; width:350px;"></div></center><!-- Module ends: ln-ctr-top--></div><!-- Area starts: main-center-center --><div id="area-main-center-center" style=""><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ctr-lt-in-top" style="float:left;" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-lt-in-top (AdCpc) -->

Mr. Bush would also change laws to guarantee that even the chronically ill could find insurance coverage, and he would induce Medicare and Medicaid patients to use health maintenance organizations and other alternatives that are less expensive than private doctors. Plans for Government Role</p><p>Lawmakers of both parties and the Democratic Presidential candidates are backing measures that would give the Government a bigger role in the health care system. For example, one Democratic bill, which was approved last month by the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, would require employers to provide medical insurance for their employees or pay an additional tax to finance a Government insurance plan.</p><p>Other plans under consideration include one for full-scale, Government-paid national health insurance to a proposal by conservatives that would require all Americans to buy private medical insurance.</p><p>On Capitol Hill today, Democrats called the Bush plan inadequate. Some Republicans endorsed it, while others merely said they were happy Mr. Bush had entered the debate.</p><p>George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate Democratic leader, called the plan "woefully inadequate," and Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia, a leading Democrat on health issues, said it was "little more than a timid gesture."</p><p>Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, the chief sponsor of a Republican health bill, said Mr. Bush's offering was a "welcome addition to the national debate." Aid for 95 Million</p><p>In Mr. Bush's speech today before the Greater Cleveland Growth Association, he called his package "the right plan" that would lower medical and insurance costs for 95 million citizens, including many of the estimated 35 million, or 13 percent of the population, who now lack health insurance.</p><p>But much of his address was spent in a slashing attack on the Democratic proposals, which he called "a cure worse than the disease."</p><p>Arguing that his plan "will preserve what works and reform what doesn't," Mr. Bush said: "When we talk about health care, we're talking about matters of the most personal nature -- in some cases, literally, life and death decisions."</p><p>"We don't need to put Government between patients and their doctors," he added. "We don't need to create another wasteful Federal bureaucracy."</p><p>The President's address drew a tepid response from the crowd of Cleveland business leaders, who interrupted it only once, when they applauded an attack on rising malpractice costs.</p><p>The White House argued today that its plan averted costly Government programs and leaves people freer to choose their own doctors and insurance policies, by using tax incentives instead of mandated Federal programs.</p><p>Under the President's plan, the maximum credit or deduction would be $1,250 for a single person, $2,500 for a couple and $3,750 for families with children. The amount of credit or deduction would fall as income rose. Individuals with incomes above $50,000, single parents with incomes over $65,000 and couples with incomes over $80,000 would not be entitled to deductions.</p><p>Those who already receive Medicaid, Medicare or other Federal health benefits would not be eligible for the credits or deductions. Medicaid, the Government health plan for poor people, covers 30 million Americans, including many above the poverty level but only about 45 percent of people below the poverty level. More than 35 million people have no medical insurance, while 34 million are covered by the Medicare program for the elderly and the disabled. About 177 million people, including many enrolled in Medicare, have some type of private insurance.</p><p>Taxpayers who are self-employed would be allowed to deduct the entire cost of their health insurance under the Bush plan regardless of income, up from the present 25 percent limit.</p><p>Today, $3,750 would be enough to buy the most basic family medical insurance. Mr. Bush would increase the maximum credits and deductions annually to offset the effect of inflation. But the increases would be tied to the rate of overall inflation, which was 3.1 percent in the last 12 months, not the higher rate of inflation in medical costs, which was about 11 percent, so the value of the tax benefits could be gradually eroded.</p><p>The tax credit for poor people would help defray some of the cost of subscribing to employer health plans. It could also help buy private insurance or a basic package of minimum benefits that insurers would be required to offer in each state.</p><p>In addition to the tax changes, Mr. Bush proposed legislation that the White House said would make the insurance business more competitive and equitable.</p><p>Mr. Bush's plan would require insurers to provide coverage to anyone who sought it and to abolish "pre-existing conditions" clauses that limit coverage for new employees. Many workers today are unable to change jobs because they cannot obtain medical insurance from a new employer.</p><p>A second proposal would encourage small businesses to band together to buy insurance, spreading the risk among them. The decision to have Mr. Bush announce his plan in Cleveland was made in part because the city is home to an organization that has lowered health insurance costs for about 10,000 small companies that way. Many small businesses around the country cannot buy insurance for employees because the medical expenses of a few chronically or seriously ill workers raise the cost of insurance for all the rest to prohibitive levels.</p><p>The White House said that the tax credits and deductions would allow about 24 million of the 35 million Americans who do not now have medical insurance to be covered and that another 5 million would gain coverage through changes in insurance laws and market incentives. About 5 million people would remain uninsured by their own choice, the White House said.</p><p>While Mr. Bush offered no specific plan for financing this package, he said some savings could be achieved by changing malpractice and antitrust laws. It also suggested that paperwork changes, such as filing claims by computer, could save an unspecified, but sizable additional amount.</p><p>Most important, the Administration plan would switch Federal payments for Medicaid, the program for poor people, from the current system in which doctors are paid for performing specific medical services, to a method in which each state would be given a set amount each year for each eligible citizen and an annual adjustment for rising health costs.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
