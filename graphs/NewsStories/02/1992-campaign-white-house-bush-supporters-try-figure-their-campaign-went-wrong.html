Buchanan out of the race, or at least slow him down. The other mistake, the official said, was the President's failure to include his proposal for a $500 middle-class tax benefit, a popular feature of his State of the Union message, in the tax bill he sent to Congress. 11 Points Lost?</p><p>One local strategist, who spoke on condition that he not be named, said the campaign's private polls, as well as some aspects of polls taken for news organizations, convinced him that Mr. Bush lost 11 percentage points as a result of the missteps. Had the President added those 11 points to his total, he would have defeated Mr. Buchanan among voters who chose those two candidates by 70 percent to 30 percent, the kind of landslide that would surely have deflated the Buchanan campaign.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-first-para--></div><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ln-ctr-top" style="" class="mod-nytimesline mod-line"><!-- Module starts: ln-ctr-top (Line) --><center><div style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc; height:1px; width:350px;"></div></center><!-- Module ends: ln-ctr-top--></div><!-- Area starts: main-center-center --><div id="area-main-center-center" style=""><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ctr-lt-in-top" style="float:left;" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-lt-in-top (AdCpc) -->

Rudman of New Hampshire agreed that the President had made serious errors, including failing to send moderate Republicans like Senators Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas and Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico to the state. But even if he had done everything exactly right, Mr. Rudman argued, Mr. Bush would still have had trouble gaining a two-to-one victory in a state where he has never been terribly popular and where the economy has been devastated.</p><p>Mr. Bush's showing here might have been even worse had the White House, warned of budding disaster at midday, not ordered a redoubled effort to get Bush supporters to the voting booths. According to a senior Republican here, the Bush camp learned from news reporters that polls of people who had voted Tuesday morning showed them splitting almost evenly, with women much more pro-Bush than men. Ron Kaufman, the White House political director, then ordered a major telephone effort to insure that women cast ballots. 'Enormous Second Hurdle'</p><p>For all of Mr. Buchanan's success here, he acknowledged this morning that with 13 primaries scheduled in the next three weeks, he faced a daunting prospect -- "an enormous second hurdle to overcome, even higher than the first one." His problems are complicated by his lack of a convenient place to challenge the President before Georgia votes on March 3.</p><p>The plan had been to compete in South Dakota, which votes on Tuesday, but the Bush forces, Mr. Buchanan asserted, "successfully kept us off the ballot there."</p><p>Buchanan aides said he had no plans to mount major campaigns in Maryland, which also votes on March 3, or in the Colorado primary and Washington caucuses that same day, although he intends to visit Colorado next week. South Toward Georgia</p><p>That makes Georgia crucial. The Republican party there has traditionally been a country-club party, to use the local phrase, meaning that it has been dominated by affluent white suburbanites. But election rules in the state permit anyone to ask for a Republican ballot and Mr. Buchanan will no doubt try to appeal to conservative Democrats as well as Republicans.</p><p>If Georgia goes well, and state party officials say the challenger could easily pull a third of the vote or more, Mr. Buchanan hopes his protectionist views will prove popular with textile workers in South Carolina, which is to vote on March 7.</p><p>After that, Mr. Buchanan has laid plans for a major effort on March 10, Super Tuesday, when eight Republican primaries are scheduled. According to his strategists, he will contest the primaries in Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Tennessee on that day, and will take the President on as well in a number of the Congressional districts in both Florida and Texas.</p><p>How many districts will depend on how much money he can raise, because only television can take his message into the dozens of major cities and hundreds of small towns that form the political target for Super Tuesday.</p><p>According to campaign officials, Mr. Buchanan has only $150,000 to $200,000 in cash on hand, having spent $1.5 million on television alone during his 45-day campaign in New Hampshire. But a direct-mail solicitation went out on Monday to 40,000 Buchanan supporters, and the campaign hopes it will bring in $250,000. Two more mailings to 300,000 people will be sent out over the next week, and the campaign said that it hoped to get $1 million in Federal matching funds on March 2. 'Guerrilla Operation'</p><p>In their post-mortems, New Hampshire Republicans expressed admiration for Mr. Buchanan's insurgent campaign, which one of them called "the best guerrilla operation since the Vietcong." But there was endless criticism of the Bush campaign, too, covering every point from the quality of the television commercials, which were described as bland and routine, to the amount of time the President spent in the state, to the decision to use an out-of-state telephone bank.</p><p>Gov. Judd Gregg, the chairman of the Bush campaign in New Hampshire, declined comment on the strains between the Washington staff and those in the state.</p><p>"I got the feeling that the White House was willing to take whatever hit they got in this state and move on," said a veteran of several Presidential primaries in the state. "They said they didn't want to go after Buchanan because it would upset the conservatives they'd need later."</p><p>Another Republican active in the Bush campaign here commented, "If the mission was to win big, they certainly didn't show it. You have to have a clear message in these things, and they were on cruise control, as if they thought that Bush was defined forever politically by Desert Storm." Persian Gulf Mattered Little</p><p>In fact, with the President's television commercials touching only lightly on the subject, exit polls showed that only 7 percent of primary voters named the Persian Gulf war as one of the issues that mattered most in deciding how they voted. Of those, 95 percent cast their vote for Mr. Bush.</p><p>On the economy and jobs, which not surprisingly mattered a lot to a lot of voters, there was no significant difference. But the President's attempts on his first trip here and in his early commercials to convince New Hampshire voters that he had not forgotten them apparently failed. Those voters who said choosing someone "who cares about people like me" mattered a lot to them, 13 percent of the total, split 70-30 for Mr. Buchanan.</p><p>Mr. Buchanan also pulled a majority of those who said their family situation was worse than 10 years ago and a majority of those who thought the national economy was declining.</p><p>There was support in the poll as well for the Bush lieutenants here who argued that the President's failure to push for the $500 exemption, which Mr. Buchanan attacked in advertisements during the final weekend, had been costly. Of those voters who decided in the last week, Mr. Buchanan got 56 percent, it showed, and of those who made up their minds in the last three days, he got 58 percent.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
