Buchanan in New Hampshire, President Bush today reached for the conservative political mantle of Ronald Reagan in formally announcing his candidacy for re-election, then promptly flew here to campaign.</p><p>"In 1980 I came to Washington as part of a team," Mr. Bush said in Washington this morning with Vice President Dan Quayle, a favorite of conservatives, standing at his side. "We started a revolution to free America from -- you remember -- the politics of malaise and to set sail toward America's destiny." Bedrock Republican Themes</p><p>The President seemed intent on staking his conservative credentials on the bedrock Republican themes of the past: patriotism, anti-Communism, a strong military, family values, small government and deregulation.</p><p>Conservatives, especially Mr. Buchanan, have accused Mr. Bush of abandoning these principles in favor of political pragmatism. But the principles sustained him in his 1988 race for the Presidency and have begun to reappear in his oratory as Mr. Bush's political fortunes have sagged from the unassailability of a year ago to the apparent contestability of today.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-first-para--></div><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ln-ctr-top" style="" class="mod-nytimesline mod-line"><!-- Module starts: ln-ctr-top (Line) --><center><div style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc; height:1px; width:350px;"></div></center><!-- Module ends: ln-ctr-top--></div><!-- Area starts: main-center-center --><div id="area-main-center-center" style=""><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ctr-lt-in-top" style="float:left;" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-lt-in-top (AdCpc) -->

"Our national symbol is not the ostrich," the President said. "It's the eagle, and that's the way it should be."</p><p>Mr. Buchanan spent his day in Carroll County, a Republican stronghold in eastern New Hampshire, and made much of an endorsement today of his candidacy by The Boston Herald, a development that clearly annoyed Bush aides.</p><p>The President declared that the 1992 campaign is a fight over the "future of America." But the day was devoted to repairing political damage and to revisiting familiar places and themes. Campaign aides say that weeks of television advertisements and visits by surrogates have not been working and that Mr. Bush must establish a stronger personal presence here. Fighting an Elitist Image</p><p>In Concord the President met with a roomful of police officers, a constituency that he campaigned regularly with in 1988. In Bedford he went to a shopping mall, where Mr. Bush, who arrived in New Hampshire in 1988 fighting his prep school image, rubbed elbows and shook thousands of hands as he tried to dispel any notion that he is remote from everday Americans.</p><p>In Washington, Mr. Bush's wife, Barbara, introduced her teary-eyed husband to the friendly crowd by testifying to his concern for Americans' suffering and his pride in their achievements.</p><p>"I'd like to tell you about the George Bush I've known for more than half a century, the man I have raised my children with, the man I've shared my life with," she said. "In the phases of his life, I've watched my husband change from a schoolboy to a family man to a businessman to public servant, from Congressman to President, from college team captain to leader of the greatest nation on earth."</p><p>While sounding his conservative themes Mr. Bush dwelt today on the welfare system, a subject he has rarely mentioned until recently, drawing enormous applause from about 1,000 supporters who gathered in a Washington hotel this morning to hear his announcement speech.</p><p>Outlining what he said was his agenda for the future, Mr. Bush said: "We'll get our economy up and running at full speed. We'll restore decency to the American way of life. We will silence the voices of hatred and gloom. And we will attack programs that lock people in bleak dependency as we work to reform our dismal welfare program."</p><p>He added: "I believe government is too big and it costs too much. I believe in a strong defense for this country -- and good schools, safe streets -- a government really worthy of the people. I believe that parents, not government, should make the important decisions about health, child care and education." 'My Supporter, Ronald Reagan'</p><p>Perhaps mindful that the conservative wing of the Republican Party has never been his political base, Mr. Bush brought Mr. Quayle, a strong conservative, and his wife, Marilyn, on stage with him and looked to Mr. Reagan's legacy for legitimacy. At one point Mr. Bush even called him, "my supporter, Ronald Reagan."</p><p>The President's announcement of his candidacy was a simple formality. Mr. Bush has been raising money and entering his name on primary ballots around the country for months. But the campaign had delayed the announcement to permit him to strike an ostensibly bipartisan stand with Congress and to get as much political advantage from it as he could for the New Hampshire vote. The announcement will have no effect on who is paying for Mr. Bush's trips, since the campaign had already been paying for his campaign appearances.</p><p>Clearly aiming at Mr. Buchanan, the President said: "Protectionism isn't a prescription for prosperity. Boil away all the tough talk, all the swagger and all the patriotic posture, and protectionism amounts to a smoke screen for a country that is running scared."</p><p>Mr. Buchanan told reporters that Mr. Bush gave a "well crafted" speech to announce his candidacy. But he said, "Take the rhetoric, place it against the reality of New Hampshire and New England, and I'm afraid the President falls short." 'Retail Campaigning' Effort</p><p>Bush campaign aides said their strategy for the New Hampshire primary rested on letting as many voters as possible see Mr. Bush and, as in today's events, even touch him -- the sort of "retail campaigning" that he credits for his rise to the Presidency.</p><p>At the Puritan Backroom Restaurant in Manchester, at a General Electric plant in Hooksett, at a meeting with New Hampshire police officers and firefighters and at the Bedford mall, Mr. Bush shook literally thousands of hands and posed with hundreds of supporters for photographs.</p><p>The stop at the Bedford mall was billed by its management as a "nonpolitical event," but about half of the crowd, which was lined up along yellow tapes on the floor and held back by Secret Service agents, seemed made up of people with "Bush-Quayle 92" stickers on their coats. They chanted, "Four more years!" in response to a campaign worker who moved through the crowd.</p><p>Besides trying to fend off the challenge from the right, Mr. Bush seemed bent today on innoculating himself as much as possible from problems that have beset his candidacy, including charges that he spends too much time on foreign policy. Today he tried to turn the tables and capitalize on his foreign policy record by crediting himself with ending the cold war, keeping up military spending and bringing down Soviet Communism.</p><p>"If you want to lead in the world, you've got to know the neighborhood," Mr. Bush said.</p><p>And he repeatedly reminded his audiences of the American victory in the Persian Gulf war last year. Mr. Bush even brought up the war when he reminded the Legislature of his March 20 deadline for Congress to pass his economic growth proposals.</p><p>At that time, he said, "I hope to be able to say that the liberation of America's economy has begun." When the war against Iraq began last year, the White House announced that the "liberation of Kuwait has begun."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
