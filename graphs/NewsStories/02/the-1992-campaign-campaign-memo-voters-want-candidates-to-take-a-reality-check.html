They did not want to be told to eat their peas, tighten their belts or pull up their socks.</p><p>Jimmy Carter's malaise, Walter F. Mondale's tax increase proposals and Michael S. Dukakis's austere and sanctimonious style all sent voters fleeing. They much preferred Ronald Reagan's sanguine message of "morning in America" and the blithe spirit of George Bush, whose press entourage in 1988 adopted the song "Don't Worry, Be Happy" as a campaign anthem.</p><p>But now, the mood has changed. Worn down by recession, Americans appear to have a lower threshold for sugar-coated promises and economic siren songs. Time for Something New</p><p>In polls and interviews, voters say they are ready for something new in politics: the truth. They say they want leaders with candor, not leaders who pander.</p><p>"I don't want any sweet talk," said Donna Ash, the owner of W. H. Ash and Daughter Antiques in Goffstown, N.H. "We have tried all the easy solutions. They don't work. We need to spend money and save it, too.

She says they are both bitter about Mr. Bush because they believe he neglected the economy and now "the bubble is going to burst and the bottom is falling out of the country, as it has fallen out of the state."</p><p>She is leaning toward crossing party lines in the primary on Tuesday and voting for Paul E. Tsongas, the Democrat with the least-sweetened economic message, because "he seems to realize that our pain is real."</p><p>Republican campaign workers in Washington say that their secret polls reflect a yearning for a politician who is willing to offer the public hard truths, not inflated promises.</p><p>Mr. Tsongas says he is not running with a red hat, white beard and bag of presents. Unlike some of his Democratic rivals, he has not baited his economic program with middle-class tax cuts and protectionist sentiments.</p><p>With more hair shirt than blue sky, he says that his fight to overcome cancer has made him especially qualified to offer the American public some reality therapy. An Uphill Climb</p><p>Unlike President Bush, who says everything will be fine if the nation just waits for an economic upturn, Mr. Tsongas says it will be a tough, uphill climb to recovery.</p><p>"There are two roads, one is easy, one is comfortable, but it's downhill," he said in the debate here tonight. "The other is the road to economic prosperity for a great America, a healthy America, a vibrant America."</p><p>Mr. Tsongas added: "I think what you're saying to us is: 'We are ready. Tell us the truth. Give us the economic truth. We can deal with it. We can prevail We are a great nation. Treat us that way.' George Bush has not."</p><p>Mr. Tsongas's approach is reminiscent of the cry of Howard Beal, the mad prophet of the airwaves, in the Paddy Chayefsky movie "Network": "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it any more."</p><p>Ted Van Dyk, a Democratic strategist who has decided to offer his support to Mr. Tsongas, hopes the public is in "the 'Network' mood," adding, "We're fed up and we're not going to take Reagan and Bush and the Democrats promising voters what they think they most want to hear and fitting their messages to polls."</p><p>Even Michael K. Deaver, one of the architects of Ronald Reagan's "morning in America" theme, agrees that "people want some real answers, someone to tell them how we're going to solve these problems."</p><p>Mr. Deaver, who turned the telegenic good-news Presidency into an art form, said he does not think Mr. Tsongas's sad-sack appearance and blurry diction will hurt him, if he wins the New Hampshire Primary and tries to mount a national campaign.</p><p>"He looked down the barrel," Mr. Deaver said, referring to Mr. Tsongas's illness. "When people look at him, they believe they're getting the real stuff."</p><p>Some analysts said that the criticism that Gov. Bill Clinton was too slick would hurt him with an electorate that may be tired of slick deliveries and excessive promises.</p><p>From the Great Depression until the 1980's, the Republicans were seen as the party of denial. For decades, the battle of imagery pitted Franklin D. Roosevelt against Herbert Hoover, and the Democrats found it hard to lose. Ten years ago, Ronald Reagan and abundance replaced Hoover and denial as the Republican symbol.</p><p>But there are signs that the public may be willing to embrace the pain, as therapists put it, and acknowledge Mr. Tsongas's claim that "there is a morning after" and "this is when the brutal part starts.</p><p>Mr. Mondale, whose proposal to raise taxes in 1984 badly hurt his campaign, said that people have begun coming up to him recently to tell him he was telling the truth, and that they regretted not voting for him.</p><p>"Maybe the public is waking up and getting skeptical about simple public relations, effortless, happy-talk rhetoric," he said. "Maybe the public is finally saying we've got to look at basic questions. We're slipping. We're losing our edge. We don't hve savings or work habits or a good educational system."</p><p>Gerald Rafshoon, Jimmy Carter's media adviser, said that voters always want the antithesis of what they have had before.</p><p>"Reagan was the antithesis of Carter because he offered blue skies and a big sleeping pill," Mr. Rafshoon said. "Now the public is desperate and they are not getting turned off by politicians who talk about sacrifice and pain. They want someone who is not connected with the establishment or the media or power brokers or any form of organized slickness."</p><p>Mr. Tsongas knows that he is benefiting from this factor. "After eight years of me," he joked, "Americans are really going to want someone telegenic." Same From Republicans</p><p>The Republicans are continuing to cleave to the politics of abundance, not sacrifice.</p><p>Patrick J. Buchanan's message is that Americans have already made enough sacrifices to end the Great Depression, win World War II and achieve victory in the cold war. The conservative commentator now offers voters the palliative that by cutting taxes, firing Federal bureacrats and cutting regulation their economic troubles will end.</p><p>Mr. Bush has engaged in mostly upbeat rhetoric, as well, scorning rivals who talk of an "America running scared."</p><p>And after years of accusing the Democrats of over-promising, Mr. Bush is trying to spur his campaign here by repeating his off-again, on-again promise of a increase of $500 in the tax exemption for children.</p><p>Mr. Bush once blithely made pledges about stopping the scourge of drugs and saving the children of the inner cities and promising that American students will be first in the world in math and science by the year 2,000. But now Americans say they are skeptical of such rosy promises.</p><p>Mr. Tsongas says that such campaign pledges will fall victim to a "fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me" mentality.</p><p>The essence of Mr. Tsongas's bad-news philosophy is summed up in his line "The cold war is over; Japan won." Voice of Voters</p><p>Fred Kelley of Kelly's Kars in Goffstown, said that he used to make his decision on gut instincts, or by voting for the Republican. But not this time. This time he has studied the economic plans of all the candidates.</p><p>"I'm realistic," he said. "It's going to be four or five more years before we are out of this. So I think I'm looking for the guy who recognizes that the most and will help us the best."</p><p>Talking about the economic blight that has cast New Hampshire into misery, he said he went through a few stages.</p><p>"At first I didn't care, didn't think it would last," said the 70-year-old car dealer. "Then I thought it wasn't as bad as they said. But it's been a long time since we could sell some cars. Now I'm scared."</p><p>John Gilman, 59, a truck driver from Bedford, reflected the mood of cynicism. "They all say they are going to save us and I don't even know if we can be saved," said Mr. Gilman, who drives a yellow Chevrolet with a bumper sticker that says, "Made-Bought-Paid For By Americans."</p><p>"I'm not a cynic, but you get a little desperate after a while," he said.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
