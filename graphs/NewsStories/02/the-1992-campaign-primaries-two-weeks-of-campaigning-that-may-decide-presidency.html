Taken together, the contests on March 3 and 10 are likely to determine whether Mr. Bush is forced to endure a long and enervating struggle against Mr. Buchanan that will keep the White House distracted and on the defensive for weeks, or whether the President can retrain his sights on the Democrats.</p><p>On the Democratic side, the next few weeks will show whether Mr. Tsongas, the winner in New Hampshire, is a legitimate national contender, and whether Mr. Clinton is truly on the mend after his near-death experience over accusations that he had a 12-year affair with a singer and tried to avoid the draft.</p><p>The next few weeks may be life or death for the campaigns of the two Midwestern Democrats in the race, Senators Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Tom Harkin of Iowa. They are struggling to make the cut, score a few victories in their region and work themselves up to the top tier. Many Democrats say there is room for only one at the top.</p><p>In many ways, the schedule over the next few weeks plays to the strengths of Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton, both of whom have carefully cultivated the South, and both of whom have the money and the organizational depth to compete in numerous states at once. Still, both men must also contend with the New Hampshire phenomenon: Suddenly hot opponents -- Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Tsongas -- emerging from that tiny state on a wave of publicity that no candidate could buy.</p><p>On the Republican side, Charles Black, a senior adviser to the Bush campaign, says grimly of the 13 primaries over the next two and a half weeks: "On the battlefield there's 13 big hills, and we're on top of each of them. We're organized, prepared, and we have long supply lines. We'll wait and see which ones he tries to run up, and try to push him back down."</p><p>Sunday marks the beginning of this primary and caucus surge, with the caucuses in Maine. This state often ratifies the winner of New Hampshire, and Mr. Tsongas has an added advantage of being a regional favorite. But former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, waging an insurgent campaign of his own, has been working this state hard, and most of the rest of the Democrats have cultivated it as well. On the Republican side, Maine could be expected to give the nod to its Kennebunkport son, Mr. Bush.</p><p>Here is a look at the highlights of the next two weeks: TUESDAY, FEB. 25 -- South Dakota.</p><p>South Dakota's primary may be a struggle for survival for Mr. Kerrey and Mr. Harkin. Unless they can demonstrate serious vote-getting ability here, in their home region, they may find it impossible to rebound. A poll conducted by The Argus Leader newspaper in Sioux Falls and released this weekend showed Mr. Kerrey in the lead, with Mr. Clinton and Mr. Harkin tied for second place.</p><p>This is a relatively inexpensive place to campaign in, which helps explain why Mr. Clinton and Mr. Tsongas have both been playing here. Tad Devine, campaign manager for Mr. Kerrey, also asserts: "People have been looking to bump us off, and that particularly applies to Clinton. His decision to enter South Dakota at the level he is represents his desire to bump off Kerrey." Some Democrats do, in fact, still consider Mr. Kerrey someone who could pose difficulties for Mr. Clinton and Mr. Tsongas if the Nebraskan's campaign got rolling.</p><p>Mr. Bush gets a free ride on this day, since Mr. Buchanan is not on the ballot here. TUESDAY, MARCH 3 -- Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, Idaho, Utah, Washington.</p><p>On the Republican side, this is when Mr. Bush and Mr. Buchanan will next go head-to-head. Mr. Buchanan has decided to zero in on Georgia, hoping that if he can score well there, it will have a spillover effect on the following Tuesday, when primaries or caucuses will be held in 11 states, mostly in the South. Mr. Buchanan is already running television commercials on Atlanta television, accusing Mr. Bush of being a taxer and a spender who breaks his word to the American people.</p><p>The conservative commentator is quickly retooling his message for the region, including a new emphasis on what his sister and top adviser, Angela (Bay) Buchanan, describes as "reverse discrimination." Mr. Buchanan is expected to hammer the President for signing the civil rights legislation of 1991, which some conservatives asserted was a "quota bill," a charge denied by its supporters in both parties. Mr. Black said the Bush campaign is prepared to counter those charges, enlisting such allies as Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina.</p><p>Mr. Bush, for his part, is expected to highlight the Persian Gulf war more as the race moves to the South, playing to the region's esteem for the nation's military and patriotic traditions. Mr. Buchanan was a vocal opponent of American military intervention to drive Iraq from Kuwait.</p><p>Bay Buchanan said the Buchanan campaign hopes to profit from a large crossover vote in Georgia, a state where people can show up at the polling place and declare their intent to vote in either primary. Merle Black, an expert on Southern politics at Emory University, said, "There's a lot of unknowns here."</p><p>On the Democratic side, Mr. Tsongas is hoping to demonstrate his national credibility with a victory in Maryland, while Mr. Clinton is hoping to start a Southern roll with a big victory in Georgia. Mr. Clinton has a lock on much of the political establishment there. "He has most of the endorsements with the Governor and Senator Sam Nunn, and that has had a chilling effect on everybody else," said Mike Kramer, the Georgia coordinator for Mr. Harkin. The reference was to Gov. Zell Miller, who mounted a bitter attack on Mr. Tsongas this week.</p><p>The Kerrey campaign has "high hopes," in the words of Tad Devine, for Colorado as well as Minnesota, strategists said. And Mr. Harkin, campaigning as the voice of traditional liberalism, is also hoping for a boost from Minnesota -- "a good state for Tom's message," said his press secretary, Lorraine Voles -- as well as Maryland and Washington state. SATURDAY, MARCH 7 -- South Carolina, Wyoming, Arizona.</p><p>This is Mr. Bush's safety net; even if Mr. Buchanan runs strongly in Georgia, South Carolina is where the Bush forces assert that they can push him back down the hill, to use Charles Black's analogy. "That's probably our best organization in the whole country," Mr. Black said. It is headed by Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr., who said simply: "We'll concentrate on the basics. It's not sexy, just nuts and bolts." MARCH 10, "Super Tuesday" -- Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Massachusetts.</p><p>On the Democratic side, this is the day when Mr. Clinton hopes that his regional roots, months of careful organizing and financial edge pay off in a huge delegate windfall. This would send him back north, for the Illinois and Michigan primaries on March 17, in a formidable position.</p><p>The richest delegate prizes on March 10 are Florida and Texas. In Florida, the state chairman, Simon Ferro, said: "Clinton got in early, had friends already in high places, and they stayed with him even when he was taking a beating. Their attitude turned pretty combative: 'Let's get New Hampshire out of the way and get him down here.' " Still, Mr. Ferro added, "I don't think any candidate has this wrapped up at all."</p><p>Mr. Tsongas, and the other candidates who are viable at that point, will be competing in various parts of Florida and, for that matter, Texas. Much of the game on Super Tuesday is focusing a campaign's money most efficiently on the vast number of media markets. "We know we're going in Florida, and certainly in Texas," said Dennis Kanin, Mr. Tsongas's campaign manager. "The extent to which we'll be there will depend partly on resources, and partly on strategic goals."</p><p>Mr. Tsongas also runs in friendly states, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, on this day.</p><p>On the Republican side, party leaders assert that Mr. Buchanan will be hard put to compete on the level that Super Tuesday demands. Fred Meyer, the state chairman of Texas, asserted, "It's such a big state; there are so many media markets and it costs so much -- what are there, a million people in New Hampshire? There's 17 million in Texas."</p><p>In some of these March 10 states, Mr. Buchanan will also be faced with another challenger to Mr. Bush: David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader and former Louisiana state representative.</p><p>Still, there are many unknowns about the landscape on Super Tuesday, and they will only become clear as the earlier contests play out. As Ms. Voles, Mr. Harkin's press secretary, put it, "A week is an election cycle now."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
