Buchanan could carry his challenge to President Bush through the California primary. The President's spokesman said a quarter or more of Republicans seem inclined to vote against Mr. Bush to symbolize their unhappiness over the economy.</p><p>The spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said results of the first three primary elections suggested a level of voter discontent that was unlikely to fade until the the recession itself did.</p><p>Mr. Fitzwater's remarks, coming as the President begins a weekend of tough campaigning against Mr. Buchanan in Georgia, amounted to the most cautious official assessment of Mr. Bush's political fortunes in some time. Changing a Prediction</p><p>Strategists in Mr. Bush's campaign headquarters in Washington have long maintained publicly that Mr. Bush is cruising to his party's nomination and that the Republican challenger would be driven from the race by early May.</p><p>But today, a senior official traveling with Mr. Bush suggested that such predictions about the demise of Mr. Buchanan's candidacy were no longer necessarily valid. Instead, the official, who discussed campaign details only on the condition of anonymity, predicted that Mr. Buchanan would dog the President all the way to the last primary contest, on June 2 in California.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-first-para--></div><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ln-ctr-top" style="" class="mod-nytimesline mod-line"><!-- Module starts: ln-ctr-top (Line) --><center><div style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc; height:1px; width:350px;"></div></center><!-- Module ends: ln-ctr-top--></div><!-- Area starts: main-center-center --><div id="area-main-center-center" style=""><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ctr-lt-in-top" style="float:left;" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-lt-in-top (AdCpc) -->

Taking a New Line</p><p>But the official said he thought Mr. Buchanan would "be there all the way," and, echoing a new line used today by other Bush campaigners, he called Mr. Buchanan "our Jesse Jackson."</p><p>The reference draws an analogy between this year's Republican contest and the 1988 Democratic Presidential race, in which the Rev. Jesse Jackson consistently attracted votes, money and press attention away from other candidates.</p><p>He said his views did not necessarily reflect those of Mr. Bush's political advisers in Washington.</p><p>Indeed, in Washington another senior official in Mr. Bush's campaign disputed the notion that Mr. Buchanan would last through the primary season.</p><p>"It doesn't seem right to me," this official said. "Buchanan's going to have to assess his own situation. If he goes to California, he can't get the nomination. Does he do more damage to himself if he stays in than if he gets out?"</p><p>In what may signal a growing anxiety over Mr. Buchanan's attacks, both Mr. Fitzwater and Vice President Dan Quayle today delivered slashing criticism of the conservative challenger.</p><p>Mr. Fitzwater described Mr. Buchanan as "the town bully" who was seeking to destroy both Mr. Bush and the Republican Party.</p><p>Mr. Quayle, campaigning in Georgia for the third day in a week, assailed Mr. Buchanan as a political trickster whose early opposition to military action in the Persian Gulf undercut his conservative credentials.</p><p>"Next Tuesday, Georgia has the opportunity to vote for the only true conservative for President of the United States," Mr. Quayle told an audience in Augusta. "Would a true conservative oppose President George Bush in Operation Desert Storm? Would a true conservative hide behind protectionism? Would a true conservative sound like George McGovern in saying, 'Come home, America?' " Economic Troubles Cited</p><p>Mr. Bush's advisers said after his victory in the New Hampshire primary, where he won 53 percent of the vote to Mr. Buchanan's 37 percent, that economic troubles figured in that disappointing margin.</p><p>But they have also insisted that New Hampshire was an aberration, a rare state where unemployment was so high and fiscal pain so intense that voters lashed out at an incumbent President simply to protest his economic stewardship.</p><p>By comparison, when Mr. Bush drew only 61 percent of the vote in South Dakota's primary last Tuesday, on a ballot with no opposition, Mr. Fitzwater and campaign officials hailed it as a "great victory."</p><p>The remaining 31 percent of South Dakota Republicans voted for a slate of uncommitted delegates.</p><p>Mr. Fitzwater said today that the President was "doing very well" in the primaries. But "as indicated in New Hampshire," the spokesman added, "there's a segment of people who are concerned about the economy and are reflecting it in their votes." Estimates of Opposition</p><p>Asked how large that segment is, Mr. Fitzwater said: "I don't know how you quantify it, but clearly, there's an economic protest vote out there. The first three primaries indicate it's in the 25 to 30 percent range."</p><p>On Thursday, as Mr. Bush concluded an international meeting on narcotics control in San Antonio, Mr. Fitzwater told reporters there was no "magic button" to propel the President through the primaries, and that "we just have to tough it out."</p><p>"The President looks good," Mr. Fitzwater said. "His speeches look good. But we've got a level of economic discontent in this country that's not going to change until the economy does."</p><p>In Washington, the senior official in Mr. Bush's campaign said that Mr. Fitzwater's assessment of the electorate "is not far off the mark," but that the share of voters protesting the economy was smaller in most of the South.</p><p>One potential exception, he said, is Georgia, where Mr. Bush and Mr. Buchanan meet next Tuesday in what some analysts say is a bellwether of Mr. Buchanan's ability to wage a long campaign.</p><p>There, the Bush campaign official said, Mr. Buchanan could capture as much as 25 to 30 percent of the vote, roughly the same as the share of voters who are soured on the economy.</p><p>While Mr. Bush's advisers have no doubt about the President's ability to win all the Republican primaries, they show signs of new awareness of the damage that a prolonged assault by Mr. Buchanan could wreak.</p><p>After weeks of ignoring the challenger, the Bush campaign is shifting course, aggressively attacking both Mr. Buchanan and his record, and playing to issues that will bring back the conservative Republicans that the Buchanan campaign has stolen away.</p><p>In a speech in Houston today, Mr. Bush spoke largely of religion and family values and attacked Government welfare, which he said is "trapping people in dependency." The President has barely mentioned welfare, a topic Mr. Buchanan has exploited, in previous speeches.</p><p>Also today the Bush campaign began broadcasting a new advertising attack in Georgia that brands as "false and misleading" Mr. Buchanan's own campaign commercials.</p><p>The Bush advertisement assails Mr. Buchanan for opposing the Persian Gulf war and charges that Mr. Buchanan's positions on international trade would cost thousands of jobs in Georgia.</p><p>The ad also implies that Mr. Buchanan is sexist, quoting him as saying that women may not be psychologically equipped to perform certain jobs. In both New Hampshire's and South Dakota's primaries, polls showed that women were much more inclined to support Mr. Bush than were men.</p><p>Mr. Bush's more aggressive posture came after weeks of suffering silently as Mr. Buchanan attacked him with tough speeches and television advertisements. The paradox was that in complaining about Mr. Buchanan's negative commercials, the Bush campaign was suffering from the very weapons that Mr. Bush used to great effect in 1988 against Michael S. Dukakis in the general election and against Senator Bob Dole of Kansas in Republican primaries that year.</p><p>Because of that record, Republican strategists were puzzled by the aggrieved tone of Bush campaign aides as they complained about the challenger's tactics.</p><p>In joining the assaults today, Mr. Fitzwater asserted that Mr. Buchanan had become enamored with the publicity generated by his maverick campaign.</p><p>He contended that Mr. Buchanan was now campaigning to secure a base of support for a more serious run at the White House in 1996, even at the expense of Repubican victory in 1992.</p><p>"He's vowed, in the television appearances that I've seen, that he's out to destroy the party, out to destroy the establishment, out to destroy the Republicans, to destroy the President," Mr. Fitzwater said. "He a town bully kind of guy who just wants to tear things down. He doesn't stand for anything himself. He just stands for ripping things apart."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
