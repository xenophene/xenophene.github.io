It's not the The Health Question or The Massachusetts Greek Issue that irks her about Paul Tsongas, either.</p><p>"These guys just aren't the ones," said the 55-year-old social worker with certainty and a little sadness. "You know it when you've seen a guy who can be President. And you know it when you haven't."</p><p>Voters in New Hampshire are supposed to be crotchety and difficult to please. That's their job. Their moods are like Lava lamps: colorful, protean, impossible to describe. But despite raging political and philosophical differences, the residents of at least one of this city's neighborhoods clearly agree on one -- and maybe only one -- thing. 'We Don't Have to Like It'</p><p>"Somebody's got to be President," said Jodie Banks, a 24-year-old paralegal and a neighbor of Mrs. Dowd and her husband, Paul, in Manchester's North End, a solidly middle-class enclave of freshly painted clapboard houses that many families have passed down for three generations.

In conversations with 27 residents in their homes here over the last two days, not one showed any real enthusiasm for a candidate or pride in his choice. Many said they were undecided; others said they were decidedly uninterested.</p><p>The problems of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, including the release Wednesday of a 1969 letter thanking an Army officer for saving him from the draft, may be impossible to overcome, but his support among those interviewed seemed weak even before the letter received wide attention Wednesday night on ABC News's "Nightline" and in today's newspapers.</p><p>New Hampshire is locked in a withering recession. Having lost more than 50,000 jobs in the last three years and with an unemployment rate in many towns nearing 10 percent, the choice this year presents far more than an exercise in people's rights. Voters who aren't numb are angry.</p><p>A remarkable boom was just about to peak for New Hampshire in the last election, and in this neighborhood -- slightly more Democratic than Republican -- the antipathy to President Bush emerged in discussions as the issue that drives all others. Qualified Backing for Buchanan</p><p>Residents of the North End want a change. Of eight people who said they voted for President Bush in 1988, only one said he would do so again, with deep reluctance, he hastened to add. Two said they would support Patrick J. Buchanan just to send a message to Mr. Bush. Both said they could never imagine a day when Mr. Buchanan would occupy the Oval Office.</p><p>And like a princess dreaming of a mattress without a pea beneath it, half of those interviewed offered wistful views of Democrats who got away, particularly the one from New York.</p><p>"Mario Cuomo would make a hell of a President," said David Deschener, a 41-year-old accountant with a wife and two children.</p><p>"These other guys have a lot going for them," he said. "They are smart and they hustle. But whatever it is you are supposed to have, Cuomo has it."</p><p>Many of Mr. Deschener's neighbors disagreed, strongly. They acknowledged the New York Governor's oratorical gifts, and some said they liked his programs, but almost all expressed anger at his willingness to encourage a write-in effort after he refused to enter the race.</p><p>"We believe in working for what we get around here," said Margaret Reed, a 78-year-old widow who, except for four years of college in New York, has spent her life in New Hampshire. "I don't care how smart he is. I don't want a President who can't bother to spend a few days talking to us, right here in the cold."</p><p>Perhaps because it has been in the news so much or because the people of New Hampshire get to act like savvy political consultants this time every four years, the idea of "electability" came up repeatedly.</p><p>Most said Governor Clinton seemed to have the money and the power, but they added that questions about his personal life could only hurt him. Virtually all insisted, however, that they couldn't care less if he had had an affair. More people said they admired his stance on the war in Vietnam and the draft than said they thought he was wrong or deceptive. None suggested he had anything to apologize for.</p><p>"I'm confused," said Bob Harden, 73, retired and a Democrat. "I was leaning toward Clinton but I just don't know if he's got the stuff to go all the way. But it sure doesn't bother me that he got out of the draft. What about Elvis Presley? He went, but he just sang songs the whole time. Is that better? Muhummad Ali said no and he's a great hero."</p><p>Mrs. Harden agreed, up to a point. A Republican, she doesn't see Clinton as a man who offers the solid direction she says the country desperately needs. But she joined her husband in defending any resistance to the war. "As if all these people writing these stories wouldn't have done the same thing in a minute," she said, sharply. "And they probably did."</p><p>Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts ran away with the prize for congeniality, intellect and decency. Many people also mentioned his courage, and among those who have made their decision, Mr. Tsongas was easily the winner in at least this small, unrepresentative survey. But Erin O'Shaughnessy, a 22-year-old student at the University of New Hampshire who works part time at a video store, expressed a common reservation with tart specificity.</p><p>"I really like his message," she said. "I just wish we could get somebody else to give it." Concerns About Tsongas</p><p>Few said they would oppose Mr. Tsongas. But several raised the issue of his experience with cancer, wondering whether the stress of the Presidency might make him sick again. All seemed skeptical about his ability to beat President Bush.</p><p>"With Tsongas," said Ms. O'Shaughnessy, "you would want to look hard at the vice president." But she said she thought too many of her friends were looking around for a politician who could get elected instead of looking for somebody who represented their views cogently and with vigor.</p><p>"It's just kind of cold to vote that way," she added. "The trouble is nobody seems able to get us going."</p><p>Asked if she would say whom she supported, she declined.</p><p>"We don't do that here," she said. She admitted to an early weakness for Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa that she overcame because of his "Japan bashing." As was the case with most of her neighbors, she said nothing about Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and conceded that she "wished" she could feel better about Mr. Tsongas.</p><p>"I just don't know," she concluded. "I'm hoping something will come up in the next few days to help me make a decision."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
