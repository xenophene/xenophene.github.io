But there have always been the little-known Presidential hopefuls, ranging from the politically adept to the naive, from college professors to local gadflies, and this year is no different.</p><p>Campaigning by such candidates, political scientists agree, is a relatively harmless and wholly American practice. "Of course, in certain countries you can get shot for this," said Ross K. Baker, a professor of American politics at Rutgers University. "I don't think this sort of thing is encouraged in Iraq, for example. So it is to this nation's credit that we allow this."</p><p>Why four New Jerseyans have decided to challenge the odds is a matter of conjecture. Jonathan Krasno, assistant professor of politics at Princeton University, said part of the explanation might lie in New Jersey's proximity to New York, the center of communications in the country. 'In the Middle of Things'</p><p>"If you were sitting in a farmhouse in Kansas, it would seem completely unrealistic to decide to run for President to get your message across," Mr. Krasno said. "Here, we're more in the middle of things, and you can see how you could work it."</p><p>Professor Baker saw other factorsat work: the "incredible high of seeing your name" posted on the national ballot, matched with a fierce determination to get views across. "Most of them are probably people who are very earnest and committed to a certain cause," he said. But a lack of any major financing or party support, he said, can take its toll. "There's just something a little forlorn about it."</p><p>Contrary to conventional wisdom, getting a campaign under way is a relatively simple matter.</p><p>A letter to the Federal Election Commission is all it takes to become a candidate, though all candidates are not eligible to hold office even if elected, for a variety of reasons ranging from being underage or having been convicted of a felony. But after a candidate raises $5,000, the process gets more complicated, with legal requirements for financial disclosure and the like.</p><p>A more costly alternative for a candidate intent on seeking a major party nomination involves filing as for that party's primary in a particular state. The registration fee for the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, for example, is $1,000.</p><p>Officials at the Federal Election Commission say the number of lesser-known candidates has remained fairly constant over the years. "We usually get over 200 of these candidates," said Fred Eiland, a spokesman for the commission. "Since there is no filing deadline, these applications just keep trickling in."</p><p>But a check of the ballots for the New Hampshire primary in recent years shows a marked growth in interest among candidates of all stripes. There were 12 Presidential contenders -- seven Republicans and five Democrats -- in 1980, 27 in 1984, 37 in 1988 and no fewer than 62 in Tuesday's primary. From the Cockpit To the Primary</p><p>Before running for President, Vincent Latchford of Brick Township was a pilot for Eastern Airlines for 24 years until he lost his job as a result of a long strike that began in March 1989, He said his public speeches had been confined to the cockpit. "You know, 'We are now flying over Ohio, that's Cleveland to your left' -- that kind of thing," he said.</p><p>Prompted by the Eastern pilots' encouragement of political candidacies in 1990 and 1992 as a way of calling attention to their situation, Mr. Latchford has jumped into public life.</p><p>His platform is based on ridding the Government of the fraud and mismanagement he says he saw within the airline industry and in the Federal agencies that oversee it. At the same time, Mr. Latchford has issued a challenge to the man he feels could have rescued the airline industry -- George Bush.</p><p>"For two years, he knowingly permitted violations of Federal law to continue, involving misappropriations of hundreds of millions of dollars from a public corporation and endangerment of the lives of tens of thousands of American citizens," reads one of the two fliers Mr. Latchford has produced since he registered for the New Hampshire primary. Several Campaign Swings</p><p>Mr. Latchford, a 54-year-old Republican, said he had already made several campaign swings through New Hampshire in his 1982 Chevrolet. He was enjoying the attention that having his name on the ballot has given him, he said. "I've been invited to speak at a bunch of schools and university forums," he said.</p><p>Mr. Latchford's wife, Lois, a high school teacher and administrator who is also out of work, has been helping her husband's campaign. The couple have four children, two in college and two in high,</p><p>Also trying to round up support for the New Jersey primary in June, Mr. Latchford has so far found running for President to be fairly rewarding, despite the fact that some of his previous supporters backed away when it came to the actual work of campaigning.</p><p>"I very nearly didn't do this," he said. "My friends had a lot of enthusiasm at first, pats on the back, etc. But then when I filed, I think people just didn't believe it -- and by the time they come around to actually believing I'm running for President, the primaries will be over."</p><p>He is also realistic about his prospects: at worst, he hopes he will get to talk to a few people. "At best, I really hope my going to New Hampshire would kick off a sympathetic wave in other states on this issue," he said. He also talks on education and taxation. "It's got to do some good," he said. Homemaker Wants "To Go to the Top"</p><p>Over in the Democratic primary, Rose Zeidwerg Monyek of Rahway has been pushing for support on a platform of "jobs, jobs, jobs." Her reason for running is simple, said Mrs. Monyek, who describes herself as a "housewife who's been running for office since college."</p><p>"Senior citizens should be the watchdogs of society, instead of political pawns," she said. "And since you can't change things from the bottom, you have to go to the top."</p><p>Although campaigning for President is something new, Mrs. Monyek, 62 years old, is no stranger to the political process. A native of Montclair and graduate of the Elizabeth schools system, she ran against an incumbent Representative, Matthew Rinaldo, Republican of Union, for Congress in 1980, tried for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1981 and sought the party nomination for United States Senator in 1982.</p><p>As a perennial candidate, Mrs. Monyek, who isa widowed mother of three, could be expected to have built up something of a following. But some of her local efforts have been against the very people who could best assist a dark-horse campaign for the Presidency. Her most recent election efforts have been a rather personal series of challenges to the same candidate, State Senator Raymond Lesniak of Elizabeth, who has just been named chairman of the state Democratic Party. Created Independent Party</p><p>Mrs. Monyek's campaigns have also brought problems with election officials, especially after she created an independent party that referred to "the unethical incumbent" by name, a practice she was promptly ordered to halt. Her most recent try, in the 1991 State Senate primary, ended when she was found to have fewer than the 100 signatures needed to qualify.</p><p>So far, things have been quieter in New Hampshire, where she is trying to rub elbows with the national candidates. "I feel I'm as qualified as many of these guys," she said. "They talk like they know what they're doing, but it's like they're reading the newspaper upside down."</p><p>Having never been elected to office, Mrs. Monyek admitted that winning this time would be a bit of a long shot. "It would be nice, wouldn't it?" she said. "I think people are ready for a woman President. But are they ready for a Jewish woman President?" Contractor's Plan To Distribute Money</p><p>Running for President is old hat to Lester F. Byerley of Manahawkin, who is in the midst of his third campaign. Using his home as campaign headquarters and equipped with a limited number of videotaped campaign statements, Mr. Byerley, a Democrat, is avoiding the primary route to stage a low-profile campaign based on the slogan "America Can't Wait."</p><p>Although he has never held elected office, he offers a legislative package to rival a State of the Union address. The cornerstone of his platform is a plan to revive the national economy by printing and distributing $15,000 in spending money to each American citizen earning less than $80,000.</p><p>While the plan may seem like a new idea, Mr. Byerley gives credit where credit is due. "This program in a way is similar to the Roosevelt era, where he printed up new money to subsidize the banking industry," he said. "We will also be subsidizing the banking industry, but this time through the hands of the American people."</p><p>Nor would receipt of this "seed money" be limited to consumers over the age of 18. 'Refinancing of America'</p><p>"Every newborn American should be able to participate in such a revenue share," said Mr. Byerley, who suggests that each $15,000 payment be deposited in a trust fund until the child reaches legal age, again assisting the banking industry. This "refinancing of America" would pay for the rest of his programs, which include an anticrime package and an ambitious program to explore alternative energy sources.</p><p>Mr. Byerley, a 47-year-old general contractor, also has a plan to revise the Social Security system. "Everyone will pay into the program at the present rate, but money will only be paid out to retirees with personal yearly incomes under $60,000," he said.</p><p>Mr. Byerley and his wife, Lynn, have eight children in their household, some of whom are from previous marriages. Mr. Byerley would push for the creation of new home-based service industries for women or men raising families. "It would be part-time employment based on a pyramid growth, which would end the need for welfare, food stamps and other subsistence programs," he said.</p><p>While very serious about his campaign, Mr. Byerley said this would be his last press interview. "Since the free press ignored me during the previous campaigns, I will now ignore them," he said. Instead, he has hit on a strategy he hopes will take him straight to the voters: he plans to set up a money-making Byerley "900" line that supporters could call to hear his stand on a different issue each week. A Platform Emerges From a Prison Cell</p><p>Jouett E. Arney is flatly ineligible to hold national office, or even to vote. Convicted in 1973 in a one-night crime spree in the Midwest, Mr. Arney is in Kansas serving four concurrent sentences on murder, kidnapping and assault charges, although he has maintained his innocence from the start.</p><p>Running on the ticket of the Freedom of Choice Party, which is based in Jersey City, Mr. Arney, 59, registered as a Presidential candidate early last year. His platform contains planks supporting term limits for members of Congress, lifting of farm subsidies, prison reform aimed at mandatory education or labor, and a detailed ethics-in-government package.</p><p>In addition to disconcerting prison officials at the Kansas State Department of Corrections, who said they had never heard of a convicted murderer's running for President, Mr. Arney surprised his wife, Rose M. Arney, who lives in Jersey City.</p><p>"I was shocked when he told me he would run," said Mrs. Arney, who is registered with the election commission as chairwoman and campaign treasurer of the Committee to Elect Jouett Arney President. "But he told me this was the one way to maybe touch one heart in the whole United States about the injustice that has been done to him." Lawsuit on Prison Conditions</p><p>A successful jailhouse lawyer, Mr. Arney filed a lawsuit more than a decade ago that eventually resulted in major improvements to the prison complex and hospital. Alleging overcrowding and indequate conditions, Mr. Arney, a high school dropout, typed his lawsuit papers on a broken-down typewriter, similar to the one he now uses to tap out his campaign platform.</p><p>"You might ask yourself, what is this guy talking about that has not been said already?" Mr. Arney wrote as part of platform. "What can he bring before the American people? But I have suffered through 19 years of injustice, and dealt with some mighty big crooks."</p><p>Mr. Arneyncludes within his general political platform more detailed data about his conviction for a murder in Kansas despite an alibi placing him in another state.</p><p>"Anyone thinking a prisoner has a chance at such office while incarcerated must be joking," Mr. Arney wrote. "I do, however, assure you I am genuine in this endeavor."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
