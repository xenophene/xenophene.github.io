His rivals ganged up on former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, the current leader in the New Hampshire polls, attacking his insistence that some use of nuclear power was unavoidable. Once they patronized him. Tonight, for just a moment, they shook his habitual calm. A Sensitive Issue</p><p>"Don't come at me," he warned them, insisting that he had been a committed environmentalist since the 1970's and remained steadfast. Mr. Tsongas had lost his temper about the same issue 10 days ago at Dartmouth College. The protracted controversy over the Seabrook nuclear plant in New Hampshire, which started operation in March 1990, has made it an issue of great sensitivity in the state.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-first-para--></div><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ln-ctr-top" style="" class="mod-nytimesline mod-line"><!-- Module starts: ln-ctr-top (Line) --><center><div style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc; height:1px; width:350px;"></div></center><!-- Module ends: ln-ctr-top--></div><!-- Area starts: main-center-center --><div id="area-main-center-center" style=""><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ctr-lt-in-top" style="float:left;" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-lt-in-top (AdCpc) -->

Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska summed up the consensus with the comment, "No political figure in America is more indifferent to jobs than George Bush."</p><p>For much of the rest of the 90-minute debate, staged at St. Anselm's College just south of here and carried by the Cable News Network, the Democrats were content to recycle their campaign speeches and punch lines.</p><p>Politicians here and in Washington had expected Mr. Tsongas to be taken to task on substantive issues and Mr. Clinton to be attacked on questions of character. It didn't happen. Unchallenged, the Arkansas Governor chose not to comment, or was prevented by the format from commenting, on the accusations that turned his once free-flowing campaign into a nightmare.</p><p>Mr. Kerrey may have sensed that the event was providing less-than-gripping television viewing. When Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa mentioned Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, whose name is not on the ballot here, the Nebraskan commented with a smile: "Did you have to mention Governor Cuomo's name? Now more people will write him in." Two Chicagoans have started an unauthorized write-in campaign on Mr. Cuomo's behalf.</p><p>In the debate, the fourth of the young campaign, it was clear that the Democrats consider the President vulnerable on many issues. Call for 'a Clean Break'</p><p>Mr. Kerrey, who seemed more focused than he had in earlier broadcasts, said early that "our President has his head outside of the cold war, but his entire body is still in it." Mr. Tsongas said Mr. Bush lacked "a core of principle." Mr. Harkin called for "a clean break with Reagan and Bush trickle-down economics."</p><p>And Mr. Clinton declared, "We've got a President who doesn't believe we need a national economic plan."</p><p>Earlier in the day, the Democratic candidates had wrangled off-screen about taxes, abortion and questions of honesty and character.</p><p>Mr. Tsongas took on the Democratic leadership in Congress. Senator Harkin took shots at two of his rivals, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kerrey, over their positions on abortion as well as on other issues. Mr. Clinton hit back at his critics, and Mr. Kerrey appeared to be trying to keep alive accusations of draft evasion leveled at Mr. Clinton.</p><p>Polls tracing the changes in voter sentiment day by day showed Mr. Tsongas holding a solid lead over Mr. Clinton, Mr. Kerrey in third place by a narrow margin over Mr. Harkin, and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California running well behind.</p><p>There were signs of stress in the campaigns of both Mr. Kerrey and Mr. Harkin as both sought to stave off possible elimination from the race.</p><p>After Mr. Kerrey's longtime poll- taker and strategist, Harrison Hickman, acknowledged anonymously sending a memorandum critical of Mr. Clinton's draft record to journalists, Mr. Kerrey disavowed him and said he was not, at least for the time being, working for the campaign. Mr. Kerrey added, "He betrayed me."</p><p>The Harkin campaign approved and paid for a hard-hitting flier, circulated by a women's group, implying that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kerrey were less than firm in their support of abortion rights. Among other things, the handbill asserts that Mr. Kerrey ran for Governor in Nebraska in 1982 as an opponent of abortion and that Mr. Clinton signed a bill in 1989 that requires young women seeking abortion to get parental consent first. No 'Hollywood Women'</p><p>In allusions to the accusations in a supermarket tabloid that Mr. Clinton conducted a 12-year extramarital affair, to Mr. Kerrey's relationship with Debra Winger and to Mr. Brown's romance with Linda Ronstadt, Mr. Harkin said in a speech to a labor group: "You won't be reading about me in the tabloids. I sure as heck won't be dating any Hollywood women."</p><p>Challenged about his tactics on the ABC news program "This Week," Mr. Harkin said, "I have a great deal of respect for Governor Clinton," but asserted that Mr. Clinton's conduct "raises questions in everyone's mind."</p><p>So much dirt had been thrown at him, Mr. Clinton replied, that he was "virtually a one-man landfill." He sought to turn the attacks made upon him into an advantage.</p><p>"One of the tests of a President is whether or not that man or woman can live with the pressure, take the heat and go on," he said. "I've learned some things about myself, I think, in the last couple of weeks, and I think the American people and certainly the people of New Hampshire know much more about me than anyone else." Clinton as Outsider</p><p>Mr. Clinton also sought to portray himself as the outsider, although he led the race here for weeks and won the endorsement of Democratic officeholders across the country. He suggested that Mr. Tsongas had always been the favorite here because he came from a neighboring state.</p><p>Mr. Clinton also railed against Washington. "You know, a lot of people in Washington may have given up hope on my campaign," he said, "but Washington has given up on the deficit. Washington has given up on the economy. Washington has given up on everything that's mattered for 10 years."</p><p>Mr. Tsongas rejected the middle-income tax cut that has been proposed by Democratic leaders in Congress, arguing that they would drop the idea if his campaign succeeds. Appearing on the NBC news program "Meet the Press," he said tax help for the middle class was needed but argued that his first job was stimulating the economy to create jobs, because if a working person was unemployed, "giving that person a tax cut is irrelevant."</p><p>"I'm not Santa Claus," Mr. Tsongas said, repeating a familiar campaign line. "If you want Santa Claus, you've got a lot of choices, Democrats and Republicans."</p><p>Mr. Bush's campaign manager, Robert M. Teeter, who was also interviewed on the ABC program, paid Mr. Tsongas a backhanded compliment with the remark that people were for him because he sounded like a Republican.</p><p>Alone among the major contenders, Mr. Kerrey avoided the television studios, campaigning instead at a suburban shopping mall and speaking at a rally in Manchester.</p><p>With him for the second time in eight days was Max Cleland, the former head of the Veterans' Administration, who lost both legs and an arm in Vietnam. Mr. Kerrey insisted that he was not trying to call attention to accusations that Mr. Clinton tried to avoid military service in Southeast Asia.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
