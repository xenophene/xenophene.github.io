Tsongas, who won the Democratic primary in New Hampshire with a campaign that emphasized personal sacrifice to revive the economy, is actually quite vague about the ingredients of the bitter medicine he would prescribe.</p><p>As he campaigned across New Hampshire, Mr. Tsongas, a former senator from Massachusetts, managed to distinguish himself from the other candidates of both parties, who promised tax cuts for families or popular new public works projects, or both, and who stressed mainly painless solutions to the economic problems in the state and the nation.</p><p>"I'm not running to be Santa Claus," he said in his standard speech. And he often remarked, "We need to put long-term good ahead of short-term gratification."</p><p>But scrutiny of his speeches and position papers discloses few specific proposals that would cause ordinary voters to bite the bullet. For example, while he calls the large Federal budget deficit "one of our most difficult and pressing problems," he says he has no plans for an overall tax increase or reduction in Social Security spending, steps that many economists believe are prerequisites for deficit reduction.

Bill Clinton of Arkansas and Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska.</p><p>He said he favored a "flexible freeze," the same words Mr. Bush used four years ago to explain how he would cut spending. As used by Mr. Bush and Mr. Tsongas, the term means that if spending is increased for some programs, it must be reduced for others so the deficit does not rise. "Do I have to reject a good idea and a necessary idea just because someone else used it?" Mr. Tsongas asked.</p><p>Under Mr. Bush, the annual deficit has risen to a record high of about $400 billion.</p><p>Like Mr. Bush in 1988, Mr. Tsongas names several areas where he intends to spend more money, including the Head Start program for preschoolers, merit pay for teachers, unemployment insurance and job training. He points to few places other than the military where he thinks cuts are in order. The only one he named in the interview was what he called the "populated space station," the word "manned" apparently being politically incorrect. Hints at One Cut</p><p>But unlike Mr. Bush, Mr. Tsongas does not rule out a tax increase or a cut in Social Security benefits. He said he does not intend to carry out either step, but he said a reduction in Social Security payments to wealthy pensioners might be necessary "in three or four years if I don't get a handle on the deficit."</p><p>Mr. Tsongas would also use most of the money remaining from cuts in the military budget for deficit reduction rather than for tax cuts or new programs, as would most of his competitors.</p><p>Mr. Tsongas's economic philosophy fits no particular school. It is neither Keynesian nor supply side, not liberal or conservative, not completely pro-business or pro-labor.</p><p>His main theme is that the United States is losing ground in the world economy. "The cold war is over and the Japanese won," he says at nearly every stop. The solution, he says, is for the American Government to be friendly to business, not hostile the way he says many of his fellow Democrats are.</p><p>"You can't have employment and despise employers," he said in his victory speech in Manchester Tuesday night. And then he appended the phrase that he has made his slogan: "No goose, no golden egg."</p><p>But he is friendlier to some businesses than he is to others, and the ones he favors most are in manufacturing. In his pamphlet "A Call to Economic Arms," which is the manifesto of his campaign, Mr. Tsongas wrote that the decline of America's manufacturing base was "our collective Kryptonite." He added:</p><p>"An ever less competitive manufacturing base inevitably means cataclysmic erosion of our standard of living. If we are reduced to just flipping hamburgers and exploiting our raw materials, we will have an economy, but it will be a diminished economy of decline and defeat."</p><p>Many other politicians and economists hold a similar view. But they tend to be the ones like Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, and Jeff Faux, the economist who heads the Economic Policy Institute, who also favor trade restrictions to give American manufacturers a leg up.</p><p>Mr. Tsongas, more than any other Democratic Presidential candidate, espouses free trade and vigorously opposes protectionist measures.</p><p>His principal step to help manufacturers would be a cut in the capital gains tax for stocks and bonds but not for real estate. The rate would diminish the longer an investment was held, and an even lower rate would be available for venture capital invested in start-up companies. He would offset the cost and diminish the windfall for the wealthy by raising the top income tax rate to 34 percent or 35 percent from 31 percent. Measures for Business</p><p>He also advocates these other measures mainly to help manufacturers: an investment tax credit, a new Government office to coordinate technology, a civilian version of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to generate cutting-edge research, waivers of antitrust laws in many instances so businesses can work together on joint projects and an agency patterned after the Agriculture Extension Service to provide companies around the country access to the latest technology and management strategies.</p><p>Mainstream Democratic economists are of two minds about Mr. Tsongas's emphasis on manufacturing.</p><p>They agree with the principle that the Government should encourage creation of high value-added jobs, those in which the value of the product depends mostly on the labor and not on the materials. Computer programming, for example, fits the category; computer assembly does not. As a rule, high value-added jobs are also high-paying jobs.</p><p>But many economists dispute the idea that manufacturing jobs and high value-added jobs are necessarily one and the same. Charles L. Schultze, who was budget director in the Johnson Administration and chairman of President Jimmy Carter's Council of Economic Advisers, said he admired Mr. Tsongas in most respects but thought that such a strong emphasis on manufacturing would lead the Government to stress low-skilled jobs in failing industries. It is better, he said, to emphasize services like telecommunications and retailing where the United States already excels.</p><p>On the other hand, Benjamin M. Friedman, a prominent Harvard economist, said he had come around to the view that Mr. Tsongas might be right. Almost the only high-wage jobs for people without college educations are in manufacturing, he said, and it is important for the country to limit as much as possible the growing disparity in income between those with college degrees and those without them.</p><p>While Mr. Tsongas characterizes himself as a pro-business Democrat, he takes many stands that are at odds with business interests. For instance, he favors strong Government health, safety and environmental regulations, and he speaks out often against high executive salaries and poor business management practices.</p><p>Mr. Tsongas almost never talks in his campaign appearances about poverty or homelessness, and they are not addressed in his campaign pamphlet. Asked why, he said it was impossible in 83 pages to deal with every issue. He said he had visited a homeless shelter recently and was told by people there that what they really wanted was jobs. With an improved economy, he said, those jobs could become available.</p><p>In New Hampshire, Mr. Tsongas's philosophy seemed to sell best with the most affluent voters. A primary day poll showed that among voters with family incomes of more than $75,000 he led Governor Clinton by 45 percent to 28 percent, but among those from households with incomes between $15,000 and $30,000, Mr. Clinton led Mr. Tsongas by 28 percent to 26 percent.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
