As American voters prepare to make choices over the next 10 days in the first caucuses and primaries of the 1992 Presidential campaign, they are confused, angry and depressed about the state of the nation. In dozens of interviews conducted during a 1,500-mile journey across the country to this heartland city, pessimism emerged again and again as the dominant mood within the electorate.

But they seem to find little in the offerings of the Presidential candidates, Republican and Democratic.</p><p>Many speak of being forced to choose between the lesser of two political evils, and they give no real indication which choice they will make.</p><p>"George Bush is in trouble, but when you take a look at that Democratic field, you know the Democrats have got troubles too," said Carolyn Hannah, a waitress in Collinsville, Ill. "That adds up to a country in trouble. It's depressing."</p><p>For people like Ms. Hannah, what may be the worst economic slump in half a century has dissipated, with hardly a trace, the national euphoria and job-well-done pride brought on by the military victory over Iraq and the abrupt collapse of Soviet Communism. What remains is nagging doubt about the strength and viability of American capitalism and, for that matter, the viability of the whole American system of government. Down to the Basics</p><p>Americans are still concerned about crime, drugs, education, the environment, energy, race relations, abortion, the homeless -- all the issues that have been in the forefront in elections past. But in the political spring of 1992, what Americans are talking about mostly is the recession, what caused it and how to get out of it. The dialogue goes well beyond the usual recitation of unemployment figures, unemployment compensation, interest rates and taxes. This time, there seems to be under way a genuine exploration of whether America should change the way it works and governs.</p><p>Average citizens have begun exploring such matters as the intricacies of the work ethic, term limits for elected officials and the pros and cons of national health insurance. They talk knowledgably of trade deficits, the financial influence of political action committees and the advantages and disadvantages of a service economy.</p><p>Ms. Hannah spoke of the "economic trade-off" she was forced to make to get good, affordable health care. She said she could have found a waitress job that paid better than the one she has, but unlike her current employer, the other employer offered no health insurance.</p><p>Like many Americans, she considers affordable health care one of the most serious economic problems facing the nation.</p><p>"I don't pretend to know what to do," Ms. Hannah said. "I just know something's got to be done or there's going to be the devil to pay. We've got to find some way to make this country work and to get it back to work."</p><p>In a nation that was founded on hope and optimism and, indeed, became a global symbol of hope and optimism, hardly anyone now boasts about America victorious, and there is cynical, empty laughter when politicians talk about "morning in America" and "shining cities" and "points of light."</p><p>"This is your 'shining city,' " Art Bensley, a Baltimore steelworker, said as he drove about the crumbling ruins of plants and factories that had been shut down in recent years as the nation's industrial base steadily declined.</p><p>"Our grandfathers and our fathers -- they all worked in these mills," he continued. "They built America down here in a sense. Now it's all turning to rust. They say that next they're going to shut my mill."</p><p>In the distance, hard by another closed mill, a ship was unloading foreign-made cars.</p><p>"I don't blame the Japanese or the Germans for working hard and shipping their cars over here," Mr. Bensley said. "What I want to know is how and why we got to the point that we don't make so many of our own cars. Whose fault is this? Don't we need some new policies? Isn't it time we stopped this?"</p><p>He waved his hand at the rusting mills that spread as far as the eye can see, to a road spur leading to Interstate 70, the concrete belt that stretches across the waist of the country, from Baltimore through Kansas City and on to the west, almost to the Pacific. On each side of I-70, there is almost endless evidence of the economic and political trouble that afflicts America, and there is anguish in the voices of the people who live along the way. Times Get Harder for Coal Miners</p><p>Rick Anderson, a 40-year-old coal miner, stands outside the entrance to the mine just south of Wheeling, W.Va., where he has spent what he describes as "the better part of a hard, hard life." He has just been laid off.</p><p>"The company never really told me why," he says. "It's just hard times, I guess. They say they'll call us back when things get better. Well, maybe they will, maybe they won't."</p><p>He turns to leave, then suddenly spins around, a hardness in his eyes.</p><p>"There's just one more thing," he says. "People are mighty angry out here, and I'm one of them. We're fed up with the way things are going in this country. Something's not right. I'm not scared of automation and new technology and all that kind of stuff we've had to deal with in the mines for years. And I'm sure as hell not scared of hard work. So why don't I have work? I want an answer. What's gone wrong?" Keep the Dreams, Hold the Spending</p><p>Mostly, Americans have more questions than answers these days when it comesto what's gone wrong. But Jack Guy, a 42-year-old high school teacher in Columbus, Ohio, thinks he knows what has caused much of the trouble.</p><p>"We've gotten outselves into the fix we're in because we've started living like our government," he said. "We spend too much, run up debt, drag out paying our bills, have too many luxuries. So one answer is to tighten up, get lean and mean. Let's face it. We've got to scale back -- not on our dreams, but on how we go about making them come true."</p><p>Unlike Baltimore and Wheeling, Columbus is not reeling from the recession. It is one of those American cities with a diverse economy, a mixture of government agencies and service companies, and it has been able to resist some of the worst inroads of the business falloff.</p><p>But voters in Columbus seem every bit as concerned as voters elsewhere about the course America is taking.</p><p>"This country's problems can be blamed on any number of things," said Terry McConnell, a high school athletic director. "The worst problem of all is getting politicians to come up with the courage to take corrective steps, especially if there's going to be pain in the solution."</p><p>Mr. McConnell said he would "vote in a minute" for any politician who convincingly promised to balance the budget. But he has yet to find that politician.</p><p>"I'll take the pain of the cuts because things will get lots better later," he said. "But what politician seeking re-election will take the pain? Find me just one. And it's the same with just about every issue. They get in office, and they determine to darn well stay in office." Fertile Grounds for Disillusionment</p><p>On a dairy farm near New Castle, Ind., 75-year-old Dorotha White complains of "crazy government policies" as she mucks out the manure left in the milking barn by her herd of Jersey cows.</p><p>"Actually, when it comes to the dairy business, the policies the politicians and bureaucrats think up are worse than crazy," she says. "I get about $12 wholesale for every hundred pounds of milk my cows produce. Now you go over to the local high school, and the kids pay 45 cents for one of those little lunch cartons of milk. That works out to $90 a hundred pounds, retail. How can anybody explain it? Stop that kind of madness, and America will be back on track."</p><p>Verlin Custer, a farmer from nearby Mays, thinks that term limits may be one answer to the "madness" in government.</p><p>"We need to clean house," he said. "Throw out Republicans as well as Democrats -- and I'm a staunch Republican. They all need to go, and as soon as possible. You'd find better leaders in this country if they weren't constantly trying to get themselves re-elected."</p><p>As for the American farmer, Mr. Custer wonders about the future. He says he has not made any money in the past two years and has not been able to buy any new equipment for the past 10.</p><p>"Two of my kids are into farming," he said, "but I've warned them they'll never enjoy the life I've enjoyed. It's just gotten too hard."</p><p>Jerry Yanos, a farmer from Straughn, Ind., near the tiny crossroads of Spiceland, says he has made a bit of money over the past few years, enough to build a house. But he, too, is worried about the future.</p><p>"The Government just won't let you alone," he said. "The Government can't farm. What does it know? But by gosh, it keeps trying, and the Congress keeps going along with the meddling, and I fear it's going to be the end of us." Living a Nightmare In East St. Louis</p><p>Farther west on I-70, in East St. Louis, Ill., life in America is worse than hard. There, the American dream has turned into a nightmare.</p><p>At an unemployment office just off State Street, amid the rubble of abandoned factories, empty office buildings and abandoned houses caving in on themselves, Marcus Campbell, a 30-year-old carpenter with a wife and four small children, waits for his name to be called. This is the third time in a week that he has come in search of work.</p><p>He is not optimistic. There has been no work for the better part of a year. He is making it -- "surviving" is his word -- on food stamps and about $500 a month in various other welfare payments.</p><p>The clerk summons Ruthie Hudson, a part-time store clerk who is seeking a full-time work. Nothing available today, she is told as Mr. Campbell and others in the waiting area watch and listen closely.</p><p>"George Bush says he's going to help both the rich and the poor," Ms. Hudson cracks bitterly as she leaves. "O.K., George, I'm still waiting."</p><p>Then the clerk summons Mr. Campbell. No work for him either.</p><p>"Well," he says as he leaves the unemployment office, "I'll just have to keep coming back. A man can't quit, can't just give up all hope. This is America."</p><p>He flashes a wicked smile and trudges off down the littered street. The stoplight on the corner is off, replaced by a stop sign that requires no electricity or maintenance.</p><p>Like Mr. Campbell, the city government of East St. Louis knows hard times. The lights are out almost the whole length of State Street.</p><p>Across the Mississippi, deeper into the heartland, the stoplights in places like St. Louis and Columbia and Kansas City work and life is better. But for the traveler on I-70 who might slip into complacency as the concrete ribbon unwinds mile after pleasant mile, there is the man standing beside one exit.</p><p>Shifting from foot to foot in a chill Midwestern wind, he holds aloft a crudely lettered pasteboard sign that reads: "Viet Vet -- Will Work for Food."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
