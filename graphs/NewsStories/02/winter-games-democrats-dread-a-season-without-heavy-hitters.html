Well, here's what Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska thinks of his main rivals, according to a radio commercial broadcast in New Hampshire this weekend: Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas? "His campaign is in trouble." Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts? "Another Massachusetts candidate who's strong in the Northeast but has little support in the rest of the country." Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa? "The kind of old-style Democrat who's failed before." All this from a candidate who himself has struggled to attract the support of one Democrat in 10 here -- yet still touts his electability.</p><p>"The campaign in this state began with the perception that this was a second-rate field," said Richard Winters, a political scientist at Dartmouth College. "During the last three or four months, the candidates haven't matured much. They haven't demonstrated a lot of depth. Some of them, like Clinton, haven't shown much judgment. So the initial impression has not been weakened, except for Tsongas, who has come into his own precisely because he has seemed calm and articulate and steady when the others have not."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-first-para--></div><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ln-ctr-top" style="" class="mod-nytimesline mod-line"><!-- Module starts: ln-ctr-top (Line) --><center><div style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc; height:1px; width:350px;"></div></center><!-- Module ends: ln-ctr-top--></div><!-- Area starts: main-center-center --><div id="area-main-center-center" style=""><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ctr-lt-in-top" style="float:left;" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-lt-in-top (AdCpc) -->

That's what many of them tell reporters who ask, and the polls strongly suggest that they are prepared to deliver an inconclusive verdict on Tuesday, with no runaway winner and no one knocked completely out of the race. Muddle, in other words. A much longer campaign than originally anticipated. And lots of pressure on the non-runners to think about late entries, as perilous a course as that obviously is. Missing Personages</p><p>Once upon a time, you could make a list of the Democrats' big guns, and it would be more or less the same as the list of Presidential contenders. In 1960, almost all the heavy hitters ran -- Johnson, Symington, Humphrey, along with a much less senior figure named John F. Kennedy. This year, the active field includes a former senator who left office in 1984, two relatively junior senators, a small-state governor and Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, a former governor who left office in 1982.</p><p>Absent from that list are Mario M. Cuomo of New York, the ranking Democratic governor; leading senatorial figures such as George J. Mitchell of Maine, Al Gore of Tennessee, Lloyd Bensten of Texas and Sam Nunn of Georgia; and the dominant figures in the House, including the speaker, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, and the majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri.</p><p>One reason for the weak Democratic field, of course, is the vagaries of political timing. When Mr. Gore, Mr. Gephardt, Senator Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia and others were making their go/no go decisions, President Bush seemed all but unbeatable; only a few weeks later, he seemed highly vulnerable as the recession took an ever firmer hold on the country. But a larger factor, surely, has been the collapse of the party apparatus since 1972. Party elders once played a key role at several points of the nominating process, discussing among themselves the available talent, encouraging or discouraging candidates according to their views of what would appeal to the electorate, looking for skeletons in candidates' closets.</p><p>The process wasn't perfect by any means, but it provided a rudimentary screening process. Now there is something approaching self-selection for Presidential hopefuls, limited only by the ability to raise enough money to compete in Iowa or New Hampshire and some sort of minimal credibility.</p><p>With the proliferation of primaries, the role of the convention and the smoke-filled room has been minimized. The choice has usually been made long before the delegates assemble. In theory, the importance of primaries might have put a premium on having a national reputation before the campaign begins, but in fact television advertising, that maker of instant if insubstantial reputations, has made that unnecessary. It has also made money-raising one of the principal if least visible campaign activities.</p><p>Candidacies have become poll-driven and consultant-crafted, and those relatively new technologies have made long apprenticeships less vital. So a man like Bill Clinton, known only in his small home state and in professional political circles a matter of months ago, could not only run this year but find himself widely proclaimed, months before any votes were counted, as the front-runner, probable early victor and answer to his party's prayers for a new approach. Clearly, he has outstanding qualities, including an incisive, well-organized mind and a gift for leadership; the Rhodes scholarship selection committee recognized that when he was a lad. But under the old system, he would have found it hard to project them onto the national screen from Little Rock.</p><p>Under the old system the party elders would have looked into the reports, which everyone in politics had heard, about Mr. Clinton's marital problems and draft record, and at least tried to evaluate whether they were serious impediments to a candidacy. Under the old system, in which the candidates tended to be people already known to the public, the revelations that have undercut Mr. Clinton's standing might have been less damaging.</p><p>Only superficially known or understood, the out-of-nowhere candidate is vulnerable to being blown off course by the first puff of bad news.</p><p>None of this completely explains why many people think Mario Cuomo, say, is a man of substance and Bob Kerrey, say, is not. Most Americans, including those who want him to run, would be hard pressed to name Mr. Cuomo's main accomplishments as governor, and many Americans know that Mr. Kerrey is an authentic war hero. Yet the New Yorker is widely seen as the heavyweight.</p><p>Some people are natural leaders, whether in football or Wall Street or national politics, and people sense it. They are born dancers, not awkward yokels who get through Arthur Murray's and forget the steps the minute they step onto a real dance floor. And some people seem to embody or at least to make credible connections to party and national tradition, while others seem manufactured, all too ready to mouth tomorrow today's poll reports.</p><p>It may be that Mr. Tsongas, now widely considered the pace-setter, will move steadily through the primaries and win the nomination, or that one of his active rivals will. But that seems unlikely to many, which is one reason why the "unauthorized" write-in campaign on behalf of Mr. Cuomo, who delights in its every move, attracted so much attention last week. If he or any of the others is to jump in, it would have to be soon; many filing deadlines have already passed, and others lie just ahead.</p><p>"If Bill Clinton doesn't weather the storm, you'll see a groundswell for others, and the best positioned is Gephardt," said Representative Dan Glickman, a Kansas Democrat. Mr. Bentsen says he's as reluctant as ever, but when he was asked in Texas the other day whether he was happy with his decision not to run, he said, "Some days I am and some days I'm not."</p><p>For the moment, it's mostly talk. There are reports of discreet inquiries by "friends" of possible candidates, meaning members of their staffs, as to the possibilities in South Carolina, Maine and California. The Draft Cuomo Committee is working on Massachusetts and Illinois and Missouri.</p><p>These things usually come to nothing. But in the years since Vietnam fractured Democratic comity, stranger things have happened. This is the party, after all, that nominated George McGovern and Jimmy Carter, neither of whom, a year before the event, seemed to those ubiquitous party leaders to have any business in the race.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
