For the last 40 years, the nation's chief executives have been products of this era, and seven of the last eight Presidents served in the armed forces during what was, in the title of the Studs Terkel book, "The Good War."</p><p>Eventually, though, even the most enduring generation must yield to its successor, and as voters prepare to cast the first ballots in the 1992 Presidential election, it is clear that this transition is haltingly getting under way. On the Republican side, President Bush of course has the classic military resume of a Navy pilot who was shot down over the Pacific. But none of the five leading candidates for the Democratic nomination served in World War II. And one of them, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, is the first major Presidential candidate who was a hero of the not-so-good war in Vietnam.</p><p>Tomorrow, the Presidential election season formally begins when voters in Iowa hold their caucuses, and Iowa Senator Tom Harkin is expected to win handily. The real contest will begin in New Hampshire on Feb. 18 with the nation's first primary. It is still too early to tell how the generational shift will play out in the coming election, but recent events suggest that the process could be painful.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-first-para--></div><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ln-ctr-top" style="" class="mod-nytimesline mod-line"><!-- Module starts: ln-ctr-top (Line) --><center><div style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc; height:1px; width:350px;"></div></center><!-- Module ends: ln-ctr-top--></div><!-- Area starts: main-center-center --><div id="area-main-center-center" style=""><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ctr-lt-in-top" style="float:left;" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-lt-in-top (AdCpc) -->

In addition to possessing a traditional political profile, Mr. Bush enjoys all the advantages of incumbency, including a fully-researched biography. Having survived eight years of scrutiny as Vice President and three as President, Mr. Bush seems unlikely to be waylaid by any newly discovered unpleasantries from his past.</p><p>But for the Democrats, the uneasiness of the transition is emerging as a major obstacle. In recent weeks, the primary campaign has been dominated not by the nation's overriding concern -- the economy -- but by something far more marginal, the private life of Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton. Last week, after getting sideswiped by charges of marital infidelity, Mr. Clinton seemed to have gotten his campaign back on track, only to find himself slammed by allegations that he tried to avoid the draft during the Vietnam War.</p><p>With the debate over Governor Clinton's draft status, the Presidential campaign seems to have run headlong into a booby trap that was set 25 years ago. As the generation that came of age in the 1960's began to run for high political office, it was probably inevitable that someone would stumble into the snare; indeed, Vice President Dan Quayle almost did so four years ago, when charges surfaced that he had avoided being sent to Vietnam by using family connections to join the National Guard. The question that remains is: just how dangerous is this trap?</p><p>Just as some of the issues raised by Vietnam remain unresolved, the nation also seems divided about what constitutes an acceptable biography for a politician who reached draft age while the war was escalating and also growing more unpopular each year. With Governor Clinton, the question is whether he misled his local draft board to avoid conscription before 1969, the year the lottery system was implemented and he drew a high enough number to stay out of uniform. An official of his local draft board has said that he did mislead them; Mr. Clinton insists that he did not.</p><p>Michael Delli Carpini, a Barnard political science professor who has studied the generation that grew up in the 60's, says he is suprised how sensitive the issue remains.</p><p>"I would have expected that one of the changes you would have seen over the years is that by now we would have a different set of standards for what constitutes a legitimate experience for a politician," he said. "And one of the standards you would think would no longer be applied would be service to the military. But it seems the same basic standards are still being used, which really strikes me as ironic, given the way the Vietnam War is remembered."</p><p>What the debate suggests, Professor Delli Carpini said, "is that we as a country have not really come to grips with how we feel about people who did not support the war. The price we pay as a nation is that when something brings it up, we don't really have a set of rules or even a language to evaluate it."</p><p>In Mr. Clinton's case, questions about how he avoided military service are complicated by questions of how he represented himself. Thus, the full depth of the nation's discomfort is probably reflected better in the experience of Senator Kerrey.</p><p>At the start of the campaign season, many Democrats hoped that Mr. Kerrey would lead the party through the treacherous generational transition; a Medal of Honor winner who lost part of a leg in Vietnam and later turned against the war, the Senator seemed to successfully combine two potentially disparate elements of his generation -- patriotism and a willingness to question authority. Even as he lags in the polls, many Democratic leaders maintain that Mr. Kerrey's service in Vietnam is an unalloyed plus for him, and in recent days the Senator has tried to prolong discussion of Mr. Clinton's difficulties. But Mr. Kerrey has also said that at times, "being a Vietnam veteran is more of a liability than an asset." A close adviser said the Senator believes his service record can work against him by reminding voters of unresolved issues that they would prefer to forget. "It's still too painful," the adviser said.</p><p>For decades, military service has been viewed almost as a prerequisite for the Presidency. The man with his finger on the button, the thinking seemed to go, should at least have demonstrated an ability to get through boot camp. Now that the cold war is over, voters may no longer see military experience as so relevant.</p><p>Some analysts say that Mr. Clinton and the other Democratic candidates, former Senator Paul Tsongas and former Gov. Jerry Brown, who never served in the military, and Mr. Harkin, who was a non-combat pilot in the Navy, are fortunate to be running for President at a time when the nation is most concerned about domestic issues. "As long as domestic issues dominate," Professor Delli Carpini said, military service "will not be as important."</p><p>But it remains to be seen how the electorate will treat the men who came of age during the Vietnam War. Some analysts worry that the nation's uneasiness with the issues of the 60's will, if unaddressed, end up disqualifying an entire age group from high public office. Todd Gitlin, a professor at Berkeley who has written a book about the decade, notes that drug use and draft resistance were the norm of the day. He argues that applying outdated standards to a new generation of public figures is like an old-style Kremlin purge.</p><p>"This purification crusade is generationally dangerous," he said. "What you are really talking about is disenfranchising an entire generation."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
