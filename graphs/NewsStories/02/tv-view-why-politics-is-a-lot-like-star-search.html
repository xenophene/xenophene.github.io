After a shaky start, the debates -- the fourth of which can be seen tonight at 8 on CNN -- are proving to be the best such efforts the nation has enjoyed or endured.</p><p>In a welcome development, NBC, C-Span and PBS barred the audience claques and multimoderators that hobbled their 1988 efforts, and the questioning, especially from the PBS team of Robert MacNeil and Jim Lehrer on the economy, has been better focused.</p><p>Future engagements promise to follow that pattern. Tonight's 90-minute debate, the last to be held in New Hampshire, will also concentrate on the economy. ABC will be the host network early in March, by which time the field may have been slightly reduced, and CBS plans to display the survivors after Super Tuesday, March 10.</p><p>But the debates have also demonstrated the limitations of even well-conducted sessions in helping voters sort out policies. Each candidate, like an actor who makes a career out of being typecast, is compelled to find an easily recognizable, tube-friendly persona to separate himself from the field.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-first-para--></div><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ln-ctr-top" style="" class="mod-nytimesline mod-line"><!-- Module starts: ln-ctr-top (Line) --><center><div style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc; height:1px; width:350px;"></div></center><!-- Module ends: ln-ctr-top--></div><!-- Area starts: main-center-center --><div id="area-main-center-center" style=""><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ctr-lt-in-top" style="float:left;" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-lt-in-top (AdCpc) -->

In all their get-togethers so far, for example, the five contenders have come out for bigger cuts in the defense budget than proposed by President Bush. Enormous sums have been tossed around. Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas says he expects to save $90 billion by the fifth year. Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa ups it to $400 billion over 10 years. Edmund G. Brown Jr., the former Governor of California, promises $700 billion over 10 years. Everyone exudes confidence in his own figures. Caught up in the bidding and with no way to measure the realistic possibilities, viewers can only wait for somebody to make it a trillion before Election Day.</p><p>There is also enthusiasm for some sort of national health plan. The exchange between Paul E. Tsongas, the former Senator from Massachusetts, and Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska on last month's PBS debate brought out a seemingly clear-cut difference in approach: Mr. Kerrey wants the states to manage health care; Mr. Tsongas would entrust the job to private providers operating under Government standards. But that is about as far as they took the subject. Position papers were flashed, but the on-tube exchanges gave the most conscientious viewer little help in discerning the real cost of either proposal or their relative merits or even how they would work.</p><p>Other differences have shown up: Mr. Kerrey and Mr. Clinton favor a middle-class tax cut; Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Harkin are against it. Mr. Tsongas emphasizes investment in basic industry; Mr. Harkin would put money into fast job-creators like road building. Real issues all -- but in no case was the viewer given enough information to figure out the pros and cons. Every road seemed to come to a dead end.</p><p>That is not meant as a criticism of the moderators or the much-improved formats. The problem is endemic to television and perhaps to debates generally, with their tendency to invite the quotable statement and to discourage the less grabby details. It does not take a professional media manipulator to recognize that the goal in a debate, especially before an audience of millions accustomed to a quick fix in both news and entertainment, is instant impact. Welcome, sound bite.</p><p>Recognizing that getting bogged down in the tangles of health care or the vagaries of what everybody now calls industrial policy is a sure way to send viewers to a less demanding channel, the candidates have naturally slid into image-projection. Here is what is coming across. Edmund G. Brown Jr.</p><p>Mr. Brown, in his curious way, has been the most successful in setting himself apart from his competitors, perhaps so far apart that he risks seeming like the town kidder. Despite having been around the longest, he comes on as the new-age outsider, determined to drive the money givers from the temple of politics. That spares him and his audience the strain of analyzing specific programs, since all programs are bound to be corrupted in a corrupted system.</p><p>Easy though it is to make jokes about Mr. Brown, whose plugs for contributions bring to mind 800-number pitches for anti-establishment tunes from the 1960's, his insurgent image is one that fans of movies and teleplays about politics should have no difficulty recognizing. Bob Kerrey</p><p>Mr. Kerrey has also positioned himself as something of an outsider, only instead of pulling down the pillars of the temple, he would mow down the pillars of Federal bureaucracy. It is a perennially popular role -- no candidate has ever run on his admiration for bureaucrats -- and the Senator is playing into the prevailing disaffection with politics: Mr. Kerrey Has Come to Washington. He is also projecting youth, energy, boldness, qualities that complement the heroism in Vietnam that keeps finding its way into his campaign. As Mr. Clinton has reason to appreciate, television is rarely unkind to war heroes. Tom Harkin</p><p>Mr. Harkin presents himself as a reformer of an older school, a hard-bitten, softhearted populist who would open the temple's coffers to the needy. He sometimes seems to be borrowing his more-compassionate-than-thou lines from a Bill Moyers documentary. Tapping into the old American suspicion of foreigners that has surfaced so dramatically in the past year or two, he has come out against plutocrats abroad as well as fat cats at home.</p><p>Every protagonist in a television drama needs a villain or a gang of villains to shoot down, and you can't distinguish yourself among Democrats by riddling Mr. Bush. In case some viewers are put off by the odor of grass-roots radicalism, Mr. Harkin perfumes his presentation with come-together pieties about God and America, which have never lost anyone a vote. If Mr. Kerrey is trying out for James Stewart, Mr. Harkin is playing Henry Fonda. Bill Clinton</p><p>Mr. Clinton is not looking for an argument; stars rarely do, even flickering ones. In the debates, he has been making much of his accomplishments as the governor of a state that has known hard times, competing in the compassion stakes with Mr. Harkin and in the youth-and-energy stakes with Mr. Kerrey, but reinforced by a claim to superior experience at managing things. What can senators know about managing anything, he seems to be asking in his cool way.</p><p>Unpleasant rumors aside, if a producer who knows his McLuhan had to choose one of these men as the lead for an election-year mini-series, the handsome, self-possessed, uninflammatory Mr. Clinton, abetted by a personable and supportive wife (the only spouse to receive prime-time attention; thanks, Gennifer Flowers), would probably get the job -- though, yes, a war record wouldn't hurt. As for last month's embarrassing moments, they could of course be a problem; on the other hand, they may add a certain frisson of romance that further sets Mr. Clinton apart from a rather gray group. Paul E. Tsongas</p><p>Romance is not the word that rushes to mind for Mr. Tsongas. Yet this knight of the doleful countenance has managed to position himself in an unorthodox way for a politician in heat. With his admonitory tone, he seems to be playing the tightfisted bookkeeper (Gene Lockhart?) who usually takes a beating from go-get-'em Frank Capra heroes. "I'm not Santa Claus," he announces, and asks an audience accustomed to commercials for pain relievers to swallow the news that his proposals do not promise instant relief. Nor do they lend themselves to 30-second exposition.</p><p>Does he really expect anyone to buy a copy of the book he has displayed twice a debate as though acknowledging the hopelessness of making his case to nonreaders? His hope must be that he will emerge as the sleeper of the season, one of the unlikely counterheroes who occasionally win an audience's heart. The Odds</p><p>You don't have to be a cynic to see the candidates as performers, and particularly as television performers. They are already trapped in the roles they have worked so hard to create. Mr. Tsongas, with the most substantive program, has the hardest job; he must turn his implacably uncharismatic manner into an asset. The truth-teller, he has to persuade viewers, is rarely a matinee idol: remember Socrates.</p><p>The others are in more conventional modes: the proven executive; the down-home populist; the up-to-date reformer; the indignant outsider. Like other personalities of the tube, they will survive or expire by their images and their ratings, which will reveal at least as much about the people watching the screen as about those who temporarily occupy it.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
