And many disgruntled with the President vowed to desert their party and vote for a Democrat in the fall.</p><p>A nagging minority of Democrats also voiced doubts about the character and honesty of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, and about the health of former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, issues that could haunt them as the race turns south. Warnings From the People</p><p>These warning signals came from a survey of voters leaving polling stations in South Dakota on Tuesday. While turnout was light in this sparsely-populated state of just under 700,000 -- only 58,608 Democrats and 44,664 Republicans actually went to the polls -- the findings underscore the political land mines faced by the Democratic field and an incumbent President.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-first-para--></div><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ln-ctr-top" style="" class="mod-nytimesline mod-line"><!-- Module starts: ln-ctr-top (Line) --><center><div style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc; height:1px; width:350px;"></div></center><!-- Module ends: ln-ctr-top--></div><!-- Area starts: main-center-center --><div id="area-main-center-center" style=""><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ctr-lt-in-top" style="float:left;" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-lt-in-top (AdCpc) -->

One-third of the Kerrey backers cited his regional ties, while 25 percent pointed to his ideas, and another 25 percent said that he "cares about people like me."</p><p>While he was the clear favorite of the state's dwindling farm population, Mr. Harkin came in second over all, a showing that could cripple his money-hungry campaign. Only 21 percent of Mr. Harkin's supporters mentioned the regional factor, while the largest proportion, one-third, credited him with caring about their issues.</p><p>And though Mr. Harkin is considered closest to labor, Mr. Kerrey did equally well among those with a union member in their household. Both men each got about a third of the union vote. Although both candidates are veterans, Mr. Kerrey had made much of his Vietnam War experience, and he won half of the veterans' vote. Mixed Outcome for Clinton</p><p>Mr. Clinton's third-place showing was repsectable for an outsider who had little presence here until the final days of the campaign. But he might have done better, perhaps overtaking Mr. Harkin, had voters not had misgivings about accusations of marital infidelities and disclosures that he tried to avoid the draft.</p><p>Asked if they were satisfied that Mr. Clinton had the "honesty and integrity to serve effectively as President," 32 percent said no and 61 percent said yes. Of the Democrats who voted for Mr. Tsongas, 49 percent said they had qualms about Mr. Clinton's integrity; 38 percent of the Kerrey and Harkin voters also were concerned.</p><p>Mr. Tsongas, the winner of the New Hampshire primary, received 10 percent of the vote here, a sign that his strength in New England may not resonate in other regions. Although Mr. Tsongas said he has been cured of cancer, some voters are worried.</p><p>Twenty-six percent of the Democratic voters said they were concerned that his health "will interfere with his ability to serve effectively as President." Nearly one-third of the Kerrey and Clinton supporters said they were concerned about Mr. Tsongas's health, as were 24 percent of the Harkin backers. Health Care the Issue</p><p>Karen Schreier, chairman of the South Dakota Democratic Party, said Mr. Kerrey won for more reasons than his local ties. "Kerrey campaigned here more than Harkin, and organization was a big part of it," she said.</p><p>As for health care, the polling by Voter Research and Surveys, an organization created by the four major television networks in 1990, found that more than any other issue, health care mattered most to Mr. Kerrey's supporters. Perhaps that was because the largest pool of Democratic voters, 43 percent, were over the age of 60.</p><p>Mr. Kerrey has made national health insurance the centerpiece of his campaign, and 35 percent of his supporters said the issue was critical to them, closely followed by 33 percent who cited the economy and jobs. Among Mr. Harkin's backers, the biggest concern, among 39 percent, was farm policy, while 47 percent of Mr. Clinton's and Mr. Tsongas's backers said the economy and jobs.</p><p>The vote against Mr. Bush was also largely a protest over the sour state of the economy. Fifty-four percent of those who rated the national economy as poor backed the uncommitted slate. 'Still a Danger Sign'</p><p>While Mr. Bush retained the overwhelming loyalty of voters identifying themselves as Republicans, the uncommitted slate got its biggest vote, 60 percent, among independents.</p><p>Bob Burns, head of the political science department at South Dakota State University at Brookings, said the protest vote against Mr. Bush should not be underestimated: "When an incumbent President cannot hold 70 percent or more in a primary against an uncommitted slate, it says there's real discontent in the ranks."</p><p>Although they were answering the poll in the heat of casting a primary ballot, more than 4 of 10 of those who voted uncommitted said they would vote for Mr. Tsongas or Mr. Clinton if either was the Democratic nominee against Mr. Bush.</p><p>The findings also showed that men were less supportive of Mr. Bush than women -- a pattern that was apparent in the New Hampshire primary. By 14 percentage points women were more supportive than men of Mr. Bush.</p><p>Mr. Bush's conservative opponent, Patrick J. Buchanan, did not file in time to get his name on the ballot here. Today, Mr. Buchanan, a conservative columnist, said the President's performance showed he was "politically as weak as a kitten."</p><p>But Don Peterson, chairman of the South Dakota Republican Party, said many Bush supporters stayed home.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
