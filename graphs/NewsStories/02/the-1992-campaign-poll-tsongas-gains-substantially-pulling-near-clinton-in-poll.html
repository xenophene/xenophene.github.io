Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California was backed by 10 percent in the new poll, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska by 4 percent and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa by 3 percent.</p><p>Among Republican primary voters nationally, President Bush leads his conservative challenger, Patrick J. Buchanan, by a 4-to-1 ratio, the survey showed. And while 80 percent of Republican primary voters agree that Mr. Buchanan is "saying some things George Bush needs to hear," 73 percent of those same voters say they want Mr. Bush to win his party's nomination.</p><p>But among all registered voters in the nation, regardless of party, 53 percent say they lack any clear idea of what Mr. Bush "wants to accomplish in a second term as President," even though he has been campaigning for re-election for at least six weeks.</p><p>This finding coincides with the judgment of Republican strategists who have criticized the President's "I care" message in the New Hampshire primary campaign. With 13 primaries scheduled for the next three weeks and Mr. Buchanan pressing his campaign, it also suggests that the White House needs to retool its strategy quickly.</p><p>It had been theorized by many politicians that neither of the top finishers in the Democratic voting in New Hampshire, Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Clinton, would get much benefit nationally from their accomplishment because so much attention was focused on Mr. Buchanan's strong showing against the President. But the Times/CBS News poll showed they have become much the best-known of active Democratic candidates.</p><p>The current survey, which has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, suggests that the President retains ample room to change voters' minds and retake the initiative, and, like all incumbents, he has many tools with which to do so. Trouble on Economic Front</p><p>Still, the poll indicates that Mr. Bush has national difficulties, not just a local problem brought on by New Hampshire's severe recession. His approval rating is hovering at 42 percent, about the same as it was just before the State of the Union Message on Jan. 28, which had been widely heralded as the key to turning around the economy and halting the President's slide.</p><p>Clearly, the speech did not accomplish its political purpose, and polls indicate there was not even a brief lift for Mr. Bush.</p><p>The Times/CBS News poll showed only 18 percent approval of Mr. Bush's handling of the economy, the worst level for a President since Jimmy Carter, who was at 15 percent in July 1979. In the current survey of 1,044 adults, 75 percent said they disapproved of Mr. Bush's economic stewardship.</p><p>Hard economic times and a belief that the Bush Administration is responsible for them are evidently hurting the President, despite his effort in his speeches and his primary-state advertising to lay much of the blame on the Democratic-controlled Congress.</p><p>Asked whether Mr. Bush "cares about the needs and problems" of people like themselves, only 49 percent of registered voters said yes, a dangerous level for an incumbent who has had three years to connect with the electorate and especially dangerous for one who has been saying "I care" again and again. More directly, 46 percent said they placed "a lot of the blame" for the recession on the White House.</p><p>On another question in the same area, 52 percent of all those interviewed and 37 percent of Republicans, a significant minority, said Mr. Bush could have avoided raising taxes in 1990. It was the President's violation of his "no new taxes" pledge that Mr. Buchanan hammered home in New Hampshire television commercials.</p><p>Not suprisingly, given his blunt style of speaking and writing, Mr. Buchanan evokes contrasting reactions among Republicans. Of primary voters, 24 percent hold a favorable view and 26 percent an unfavorable view of the television commentator, columnist and former White House speech writer.</p><p>Nevertheless, 44 percent said Mr. Buchanan, who has never held elective office, "has the ability to be an effective President," while 34 percent disagreed with that.</p><p>Republican primary voters preferred Mr. Bush as the party's nominee, with 73 percent backing him, 17 percent supporting Mr. Buchanan, and 2 percent choosing David Duke of Louisiana, a former Ku Klux Klan leader. Bush Leads Democratic Rivals</p><p>The Democratic electorate has reached no consensus about a preferred challenger to Mr. Bush, at least partly because the party's candidates remain poorly defined in the public mind. Exactly half the Democratic primary voters questioned in the survey expressed no opinion about Mr. Clinton, despite torrents of publicity about accusations of marital infidelity and of efforts of avoid the draft during the Vietnam War. Even fewer had an opinion about the other candidates.</p><p>As a result, perhaps, Mr. Bush lost a trial heat against an unnamed and possibly idealized Democratic nominee, 40 percent to 45 percent, but he won theoretical races among registered voters: against Mr. Clinton by 51 to 40, against Mr. Tsongas by 47 to 40 and against Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, often mentioned as a possible late starter in the race, by 52 to 33.</p><p>Both Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Clinton are rated favorably by 33 percent of Democratic primary voters nationally, but Mr. Tsongas is rated unfavorably by only 9 percent, while Mr. Clinton is so characterized by 16 percent. That could be the result of the accusations against Mr. Clinton this month.</p><p>Though relatively unknown, the Democratic hopefuls are apparently gradually persuading voters that they constitute a reasonable pool of talent. Last October, 64 percent of Democratic voters said they wished there were more choices, but this week only 45 percent said additional candidates were needed, while another 45 percent said they were satisfied with the field.</p><p>Among three potential late starters whose support was explicitly gauged in the poll, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, on whose behalf a write-in campaign was waged in New Hampshire, is the most popular. He is followed by Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the 1988 Vice Presidential nominee, and Mr. Gephardt.</p><p>Voters in New Hampshire repeatedly emphasized to reporters this year that "the issues" were what mattered most to them, and the 820 registered voters among those interviewed in the Times/CBS News poll said the same thing. Seventy-two percent said issues would play the largest role in their decision on how to vote; the next most frequently mentioned criterion, a candidate's moral character, was ranked first by only 5 percent.</p><p>But other answers suggested deeper currents. Asked whether the accusation about Mr. Clinton's marital life would affect their votes, 61 percent said no. But when asked whether the accusation would affect how other voters would react, only 28 percent said they thought the accusation would be seen as immaterial. HOW THE POLL WAS CONDUCTED</p><p>The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted on Wednesday and Thursday with 1,044 adults, including 820 registered voters, around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.</p><p>The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the continental United States. The exchanges were chosen to insure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. The numbers were then screened so that calls would be placed to residences only. Within each household one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent to the poll.</p><p>The results have been weighted to take account of a household's size and the number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age and education.</p><p>In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.</p><p>The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, for those who say they vote in Democratic primaries or caucuses, it is plus or minus five percentage points. For Republican primary and caucus voters, it is six percentage points.</p><p>In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
