Mario M. Cuomo traveled to the New Hampshire media market today to deliver a speech that won as much attention for its timing as for its substance.</p><p>Six days before the Presidential primary in New Hampshire, where Cuomo supporters are waging an unauthorized write-in campaign for the New York Governor, Mr. Cuomo went to Harvard to denounce what he described as a practice of scapegoating the poor for the country's economic problems.</p><p>"In 1932, people blamed the rich, the stockbrokers, the mighty industrial barons, the bankers and the landowners, the powerful officials and politicians who failed them," Mr. Cuomo said tonight to an audience of several hundred students and faculty members.</p><p>"This time, the powerful, instead of confessing error and pledging to correct it, are deflecting the blame from themselves to the powerless: to the poor, to the child who just had a child, to the new immigrants."</p><p>The content of Mr. Cuomo's speech was clearly aimed at the Republicans, both in his state and elsewhere, who have transformed welfare into an emotional campaign issue in the last two years.

Kennedy School of Government, his message had been largely obscured by his decision to give the speech when and where he gave it. Although school officials said the date of the speech was decided on early in January, before the recent troubles of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, Mr. Cuomo's address in effect upstaged the candidates who had failed to catch fire in New Hampshire.</p><p>The Governor's visit to Boston put him under the eye of political reporters who left nearby New Hampshire -- and the Democratic candidates vying for their attention -- to come hear Mr. Cuomo, as well as Boston television and newspapers, whose reports are available to most New Hampshire voters.</p><p>For Mr. Cuomo, who has a record of overshadowing Presidential campaigns that he has declined to join, the speech seemed to offer the best of all political worlds, the chance to act like a candidate without being one.</p><p>For the first time in months, he took reporters from Albany on the state plane. Accompanied by Boston television crews, he paid a call at City Hall on Mayor Raymond L. Flynn, who recently encouraged him to run.</p><p>When he arrived at Harvard, he was greeted by a small band of placard-waving fans. The speech, which attracted 11 television cameras, was broadcast into much of New Hampshire by Boston radio stations and was televised live on C-Span. Lowering Expectations</p><p>In an interview on the flight to Boston, Mr. Cuomo even engaged in the time-honored campaign tradition of lowering expectations. He said his aides had told him that winning 2 or 3 percent of the vote in a write-in campaign "would be very high."</p><p>The organizers of the New Hampshire write-in effort have set a goal of getting 15 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary on Tuesday.</p><p>Despite appearances, Mr. Cuomo reiterated that he had no plans to join the race and that he faced the same obstacle he faced on Dec. 20, when he said the lack of a state budget would keep him out of the race. And he said his failure to discourage the write-in campaign should not be interpreted as encouragement to his supporters in New Hampshire.</p><p>"When you encourage, you encourage," he said. "What more can I do other than say, 'I'm not running, New Hampshire'?</p><p>"I'm not encouraging them, I'm not discouraging them," Mr. Cuomo said.</p><p>In answering a student's question after his speech, Mr. Cuomo said: "In my own state, they're saying lousy things about me. If they want to say nice things about me in New Hampshire, I'm going to encourage them."</p><p>Mr. Cuomo also dismissed the notion that his continued presence on the Presidential scene might harm the five announced candidates.</p><p>"If anyone is beaten, it will not be by a candidate who never showed up," he said. "It's because they failed to reach the voters. If the other team doesn't show up, it's very hard to claim that they fouled you." A Minor Annoyance</p><p>Officials with the Democratic campaigns characterized Mr. Cuomo's speech and his write-in candidacy as a minor annoyance.</p><p>Tad Devine, the campaign director for Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, suggested that Mr. Cuomo's method enabled him to enjoy the glory of a national campaign without enduring its constant illumination.</p><p>"The problem with jumping in the water is that you get wet," he said.</p><p>Officials with Mr. Cuomo's office and the Kennedy School said there was no conspiracy involved in the timing of the Governor's speech.</p><p>They said Mr. Cuomo had a standing invitation to speak at the school. Last fall, they said, two Harvard professors with close ties to Mr. Cuomo -- his former budget director, Dall W. Forsythe, and his nominee for the state's social services commissioner, Mary Jo Bane -- suggested a speech on the policy and politics of welfare. Delicious Timing</p><p>As it happened, the timing was delicious both for the Cuomo aides who still hope their boss will run and for the Kennedy School, which enjoys the attention.</p><p>The speech came at a time when the continuing troubles of Governor Clinton's campaign in the New Hampshire polls revived speculation that a new Democrat would join the race. That guessing game accelerated today after Mr. Clinton released a letter he had written in 1969 expressing his objection to the draft in the Vietnam War.</p><p>It also came as polls showed support growing for the Cuomo write-in movement, which plans to broadcast its first television commercials on Thursday.</p><p>The National Draft Cuomo for President Committee has raised about $90,000. Draft officials said they had had no contact with the Governor or his staff and had received no assitance in raising money from the Cuomo political organization.</p><p>Mr. Cuomo's visit to Boston came on the day that President Bush officially declared his candidacy in New Hampshire, allowing the country's top political columnists to enjoy a mid-February double-header by watching Mr. Bush in Concord, N.H., this afternoon and then driving to Harvard to catch Mr. Cuomo this evening.</p><p>In his speech, Mr. Cuomo criticized Mr. Bush for relying on low interest rates to revive the economy and for offering "palliatives" rather than substantive recommendations for economic growth.</p><p>"Even if monetary steroids arouse the economy temporarily in time to fool the electorate in November, that's not going to do anything to to deal with the profound weakness that threatens our future," he said.</p><p>The real campaign stood little chance when confronted with the circus next door.</p><p>J. Joseph Grandmaison, the former Democratic chairman in in New Hampshire and a Cuomo fan, said he did not think twice about driving to Boston to hear Mr. Cuomo.</p><p>"You're talking to someone who loves political theater," he said, "so therefore I think it's great."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
