"He seems like a good man to me. He doesn't brag like some of the other candidates."</p><p>In other words, Mr. Clinton as soft-spoken, Dixie-inflected, yes-ma'am, no-ma'am son of the South counts for more than Bill Clinton as tabloid target.</p><p>Interviews with a number of voters and public officials throughout the South suggest that sentiment for Mr. Clinton is holding firm in spite of reports in a supermarket tabloid of marital infidelity and assertions that he had tried to avoid the draft in the Vietnam era. Many analysts had wondered whether the accusations would erode support in his conservative home base.</p><p>A strong showing in the Southern primaries culminating on March 10, Super Tuesday, in which he has long been expected to do well, could provide the Arkansas Governor with a significant lift in his quest for the Democratic Presidential nomination.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-first-para--></div><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ln-ctr-top" style="" class="mod-nytimesline mod-line"><!-- Module starts: ln-ctr-top (Line) --><center><div style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc; height:1px; width:350px;"></div></center><!-- Module ends: ln-ctr-top--></div><!-- Area starts: main-center-center --><div id="area-main-center-center" style=""><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ctr-lt-in-top" style="float:left;" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-lt-in-top (AdCpc) -->

At the least, the questions have erased the sense of Mr. Clinton's invincibility in the region.</p><p>"I think he's got problems," said Larry James, a painter who works at Newton General Hospital in nearby Covington. "People pick up on that, particularly his marital problems. We're just not like people up North. There are things they don't care about there that make a difference to us."</p><p>Mr. James said he was leaning toward President Bush, regardless of what happened with the Democrats.</p><p>But among Southern Democratic officials, Mr. Clinton retains the support of the overwhelming majority.</p><p>He has resources and an organization that dwarf those of his rivals, and his main opponent seems to be a heretofore little-known former Senator from Massachusetts with no real organization in any Southern state.</p><p>Thus, when Paul E. Tsongas, the top vote getter in the New Hampshire primary last week, and Mr. Clinton arrived here on Friday to address the annual gathering of Georgia Democrats, the front page of The Atlanta Journal featured a large color picture of Mr. Clinton with a quote above it from Lieut Gov. Pierre Howard reading: "Tsongas is not Greek for Bubba."</p><p>Representative John Lewis, the Georgia Congressman and civil rights pioneer, who endorsed the Arkansan on Friday, said Mr. Clinton would "win the Southern primaries in a sweep and will be the nominee of the party." 'Referendum on the Future'</p><p>"The rank-and-file voters here in the South are not going to be concerned with the draft issue," Mr. Lewis said. "They want to get good health care, to send their children to good schools, to get a job. This election is a referendum on the future, not the past."</p><p>One of the important Super Tuesday primaries will be in Texas, and a poll there reported in The Houston Chronicle today showed Mr. Clinton with the support of 40 percent of the state's likely Democratic primary voters. Mr. Tsongas was backed by 9 percent, and 42 percent remained undecided. The poll of 400 Democrats had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points.</p><p>In the full poll of 835 likely voters of both parties, conducted Feb. 12-19, two-thirds said the press had paid too much attention to Mr. Clinton's personal life, and more than half said the personal issues would have no effect on their voting. But 3 in 10 said they would be much less or somewhat less likely to vote for Mr. Clinton because of the questions. These figures had a four-point margin of error. 'What the Democrats Need'</p><p>Few Southerners seem willing to say Mr. Clinton is home free, and additional damaging publicity could transform the campaign, which includes primaries in Georgia on March 3 and South Carolina on March 7, followed by Super Tuesday balloting on March 10 in Texas, Florida, Mississippi, Tennessee and Louisiana. But for now, Mr. Clinton seems to have weathered the storms that set back his campaign for weeks.</p><p>"He's a Southerner, who can get the support of blacks and whites," said John Corbett, pastor of Springfield Baptist Church in Greenville, S.C. "He's what the Democrats need. He's moderate, mainstream, a decent man."</p><p>Asked about accusations of infidelity, he said: "I do believe in forgiviness and grace, and I'm just not willing to cut somebody's neck off because they've done something in the past."</p><p>Of 14 people interviewed in South Carolina last week, only one cited the marital and draft questions as a reason for voting against Mr. Clinton Many See Problems</p><p>Other Southerners, however, do see fundamental problems.</p><p>When Mr. Clinton campaigned Thursday in Savannah, his audience included John Siebert, an unemployed disabled veteran from nearby Hinesville who came with six other disabled veterans to protest the appearance.</p><p>"A lot of people served their country, and he ran off to England," said Mr. Siebert, who carried a sign reading, "No draft dodger or playboy for President."</p><p>Similarly, the Rev. Joe Lovelady, pastor of the East Edgewater Baptist Church in New Orleans, said he was troubled by both questions and thought Mr. Clinton had been seriously damaged in the South.</p><p>"There is a strong streak of Puritanism, in this country," he said, adding that although people talk about a liberal approach, "when we close the curtain to the voting booth, we find the Puritanism creeping in."</p><p>But even in Hinesville, Ga., with an economy heavily dependent on the military operations at Fort Stewart, there is sympathy for Mr. Clinton and doubt about the validity or relevance of the accusations against him. 'Reached a Saturation Point'</p><p>"Every time, somebody runs for office, whether it's in the White House or here in Hinesville, they're going to dig up dirt, whether it's true or not," said Sheila Bowdle, manager of Leroy's, a pawn shop.</p><p>And, even among conservative voters, Mr. Clinton may be benefiting from a kind of scandal fatigue and a backlash against what some see as the constant drumbeat of stories about the private affairs of public people.</p><p>"I think people have just reached a saturation point," said Ida Vaughn, a 66-year-old grandmother who owns a feed store in Simpsonville, S.C. "First there was that Supreme Court deal and the Kennedy affair and by the time we got to this, people were sick of it. This was just a lot of stirring."</p><p>Still, Mrs. Vaughn, who describes herself as a Democrat who voted in 1988 for George Bush, said she was not overly impressed with any of the Democrats and hoped someone else ran.</p><p>In fact, most people interviewed said they had not made up their minds about how they would vote.</p><p>But Mr. Clinton's advantages in the region appear enormous. With endorsements from powerful black leaders like Mr. Lewis and Representative Mike Espy of Mississippi and most of the influential Hispanic politicians in Texas, he is the only candidate with a base in the minority populations that are critical in Southern Democratic primaries.</p><p>The Rev. Zebadee Bridges, pastor of the Asia Baptist Church in New Orleans and president of the Inter-Denominational Alliance of more than 300 black churches in the New Orleans area, said he and many of his colleagues were praising Mr. Clinton.</p><p>"This is politics," he said of the questions about Mr. Clinton. "These are issues that were brought up to destroy this man. We're not concerned about those issues. We're concerned about this country."</p><p>Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, a Clinton supporter, said Friday that he did not think the accusations would damage Mr. Clinton unless another candidate made a concerted effort to emphasize them. He conceded that whether or not the other Democrats tried to exploit the issues, the Republicans certainly would. Others agreed.</p><p>"I think Clinton will do very well in the Southern primaries," said Hastings Wyman, editor of the Southern Political Report, a newsletter. "I don't think the draft issue will hurt Clinton much in the primaries. I think when it will be an issue is November."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
