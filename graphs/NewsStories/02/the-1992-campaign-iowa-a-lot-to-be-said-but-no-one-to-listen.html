Moeckly, a sixth-generation cattle breeder in the gentle hills here north of Des Moines, has a message for President Bush: "I don't know why he took his junk car people with him to Japan and didn't take beef and pork producers. The Japanese are tired of eating fish heads and rice."</p><p>Edith Southwick of Milo, a Burger King employee, wants the Democratic Presidential candidates to know that all is not tranquil in her southeast Iowa town: "We have gangs, drugs, racial problems. We have rapes, shootings, murders -- all in a small town."</p><p>And Elmer Hoffman, a 66-year-old retired truck driver from Sioux City on the state's western border, offers this advice to all the candidates: "Let's take care of the elderly. A lot of people ain't got no insurance. And the middle class have to be taken care of."</p><p>Four years ago, chances are that all three of these Iowans could have spoken their minds directly to the Presidential contenders, who practically moved into this state, often posing for pictures with barnyard animals, to woo supporters in the months leading up to the Iowa caucuses.

But with Senator Tom Harkin as the favorite son, other Democrats are forfeiting Iowa, and in the Republican caucuses, there is no challenge to President Bush.</p><p>With Presidential candidates all but ignoring Iowans this year, the issues addressed in the national political dialogue have decidedly shifted from past primary seasons. For what Iowans have to say about the condition of the country is not always the same as what the citizens say in New Hampshire, where the first primary will be held on Feb. 18.</p><p>In interviews around the state, Iowans, who had grown accustomed to receiving a disproportionate share of political attention, say their issues are getting short shrift this time. Their biggest complaint was the lack of discourse on agriculture. While they commended the candidates for emphasizing the need for better health care, voters in this state, which has a large elderly population, said they wanted to hear more. Though economic conditions are not as tough here as in New Hampshire, Iowans also cited the economy as one of their biggest concerns. Quiet, Not Frenzy</p><p>"For the last 12 years, Midwest and agriculture issues were front and center on the national agenda," said Lowell Junkins, the Democratic candidate for Governor here in 1986. "This year, there isn't any debate about agriculture. There's no serious debate about Midwest problems. It's more about the problems of the industrial Northeast."</p><p>Unlike the weeks before the caucuses four years ago, this year interest groups are quiet, and there are no signs of the American Association of Retired Persons or the Iowa Farm Unity Coalition, which in the past have set up shop to mobilize voters behind their issues.</p><p>"It's like political tumbleweed blowing through the streets of Des Moines," said Phillip J. Roeder, who was spokesman for a Iowa Democratic Party during the 1988 campaign.</p><p>"The candidates focus in on what's going to provide them the most good locally in those early tests," Mr. Roeder said. "And there are just not a lot of corn and cattle operations in New Hampshire."</p><p>Even so, Mr. Moeckly, 63, and his wife, Marilyn, 62, owners of one of the largest farms in the area, sat around their kitchen table Saturday evening, voicing disappointment that the candidates are not talking about farming. 'Let's Get Some Exports'</p><p>In 1988, Mrs. Moeckly said she supported Senator Bob Dole, a Kansas Republican, while Mr. Moeckly did not vote. This time, she said they both supported Mr. Bush because "he knows how politics works, and I don't believe that we'd better change now." But Mrs. Moeckly said she would like Mr. Bush "to work harder on opening foreign markets -- let's get some exports."</p><p>But smaller farmers, like Linda Terry of the southwestern Iowa town of Greenfield who works in Mr. Harkin's office in Des Moines, blame Republicans for troubles they have been having in recent years. Ms. Terry also complained that she has heard only two Democrats, Mr. Harkin and Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, talk about agriculture.</p><p>"Four years ago, everybody had a farm policy or there wasn't any point in coming to Iowa," said Ms. Terry, 42. "We've lost several hundred farmers in the last four years. The farmers that are left, a whole tier of them, have come under financial stress."</p><p>Though Ms. Southwick, the Burger King worker, said she was particularly concerned about crime in her rural community, she also called on the candidates to energize the economy. She said she would probably vote for Mr. Harkin because he was from Iowa.</p><p>Kathryn Schoen, a 63-year-old court clerk from Des Moines, said she had planned to vote for Mr. Harkin until she thought about his vote to raise Senators' pay.</p><p>"I like the idea of making jobs and helping the middle class," she said. "But I tell you what bothered me about Harkin is he voted for that $23,000 raise. That wasn't quite kosher. I liked him till then." Bush Supporter Unaffected</p><p>One voter who seems unaffected by the absence of a contested race here is Tom Bernau, a 31-year-old lawyer from Des Moines. He said he backed Mr. Bush at the caucus here four years ago and intended to do so again.</p><p>Mr. Bernau said his only qualm about the President was his handling of the economy. "I think he could have been more attuned to economic issues," he said.</p><p>Mark Pogge, a college administrator from Des Moines, also ranks the economy as the top issue. But he said he was torn between two Democrats, Mr. Harkin and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas.</p><p>Mr. Pogge, 35, said he was distressed that he could not confer with the candidates personally to seek their views, as he did in 1988.</p><p>Disputing the notion that issues of significance to Iowans are not being addressed this year is Senator Paul Simon, an Illinois Democrat who did his share of posing with hogs here when he ran for President in 1988.</p><p>"One thing that really surprised me when I was a Presidential candidate, and I think television plays a major role here," he said, "is that whether you're in New Hampshire or Iowa or New Orleans or Portland, Ore., with rare exception the questions are pretty much the same. We really have become one nation much more than people realize."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
