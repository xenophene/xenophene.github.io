He was talking to the board of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, many of whom were already wearing blue-and-white "Harkin for President" buttons. The stop at the end of a hard day of campaigning was billed as a courtesy call, since the union local had already endorsed his bid for the Democratic Presidential nomination. But Harkin was neither tired nor going through the motions.</p><p>As the union leaders gazed up at their standard-bearer adoringly -- the women in sensible shoes, the men in plaid flannel shirts, blue jeans and beards -- Harkin made a heartfelt pitch for help.</p><p>This Presidential race would be like a boxing match, he told them. "I know I can whip George Herbert Walker Bush," he said, slowly reciting Bush's four-part name to emphasize the President's patrician origins. "But I need you to open the ropes and give me a shove in the butt to get me into the ring. Once I'm in the ring, I know I can flatten him," Harkin said, his fists flailing the air.

Bill Clinton, the Arkansas Governor, has been the front-runner since mid-January -- momentum that not even widely published, and vehemently denied, allegations of marital infidelity have significantly slowed. Meanwhile, opinion polls in December and January continued to register a steady slide in support for Harkin. A poll sponsored by The Boston Globe in late January ranked him next to last in the race, ahead of only Edmund G. Brown Jr., the former Governor of California. According to the Globe poll, Harkin, who has fashioned a campaign based on the theme that he is the only "real" Democrat in the race, was favored by only 8 percent of prospective New Hampshire voters.</p><p>While political professionals caution that Harkin cannot be written off yet, they also agree that his campaign has yet to catch fire. The question being debated among political pros is why. The dispute says much about the state of the Democratic Party today. It also provides some initial indicators about the kind of candidate Americans are most likely to be drawn to even during a period of intense economic distress and growing pessimism about the country's future. Moreover, Harkin's candidacy has crystallized into a tug of war among the party faithful over campaign strategy.</p><p>Harkin supporters argue that to win, Democrats must excite their traditional base and expand upon it by pushing the old-fashioned Democratic values -- support for the working class, the elderly, women, blacks and minorities, society's traditional underdogs against big business.</p><p>"I, for one, would like to see a campaign with a meat-and-potatoes Democrat, a campaign in which the traditional Democratic message is finally tested," says Lane Kirkland, the head of the nation's largest union group, the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which is remaining neutral in the race, at least until after New Hampshire.</p><p>But supporters of Clinton, of Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and even of Paul E. Tsongas, the former Massachusetts Senator, maintain that to recapture the White House, Democrats must abandon the hackneyed Harkin rhetoric and articulate a more centrist political message that speaks to the amorphous "middle class." If Democrats are to win in November, the argument goes, they must stop frightening voters; they must recognize that many Americans today are as apprehensive about what Government can do to them as for them.</p><p>Because the first test of the 1992 campaign, the Iowa caucus tomorrow, has virtually been conceded to Harkin, the state's favorite son, the New Hampshire primary, which will be held Feb. 18, is shaping up as a critical referendum on the future direction of the Democratic Party and the message Democrats will present to Americans this November in their effort to beat George Bush.</p><p>CRITICS OF THE HARKIN CAMPAIGN FALL into three sometimes-overlapping categories: those who argue that Tom Harkin is a poor messenger with a winning political message; those who like the messenger but complain about the way the message is being packaged, and those who don't like the message at all.</p><p>Basically, Harkin's message is the old Democratic Party gospel with a Midwestern twang straight out of "The Grapes of Wrath." While the other Democratic candidates are selling what Harkin would call Republicanism with a heart, he declares class warfare. He portrays himself as the champion of "the little guy," of "the average working man and woman," battling against "the fat cats" who use their influence to grab an unfair share of the nation's goodies for themselves and their friends.</p><p>His is a latter-day prairie populist's blend of individualism, coupled with compassion for the less fortunate. He advocates a more active role for Government in rebuilding America's infrastructure and redressing the nation's economic and social ills, and a far less intrusive Government in citizens' private lives. Though he is a veteran of five terms in the House and the only Iowa Democrat to have won re-election to two consecutive terms in the Senate, there is something of the loner, the outsider, the radical in Harkin's voice.</p><p>"If you want a Democrat who is gonna tinker with the system, make some small changes in Reagan-Bush trickle-down economics, don't vote for me," he says in interviews and on camera. "But if you want a President who is gonna make major changes, invest in America to create jobs and get this country moving again, I'm your man."</p><p>Harkin is a man of liberal principle. Although a Catholic and personally opposed to abortion, he is staunchly for abortion rights. "For the life of me," Harkin says, "I can't understand why people who want to get the Government off our backs are perfectly content to see Government involved in the most intimate decision a woman can make." While Clinton and Kerrey (and apparently a majority of the electorate) favor capital punishment, Harkin denounces the practice as "uncivilized," noting that the United States joins the former Soviet Union and Libya in sanctioning the death penalty. Except for gun control -- he claims to like hunting -- he has what many liberals consider a nearly perfect record on civil liberties and civil rights issues.</p><p>In 1974, he offered and won approval for legislation banning foreign aid to countries that consistently violate human rights, a measure hailed for having put the Democrats squarely in favor of restoring "morality" in foreign policy. But his protectionist trade policies and isolationism -- he opposed the Gulf war, aid to the Nicaraguan contras and American involvement in Central America -- have alienated several liberal activist Democrats who would have been expected to support him.</p><p>"What you see is what you get," says his wife, Ruth, a tough-minded and well-liked lawyer at the influential Washington firm of Akin, Gump, Hauer & Feld. A former prosecutor and the first woman elected county attorney in Iowa, she is her husband's chief political adviser, or more accurately, she insists, the "longest serving."</p><p>Much of what Harkin is today is rooted in his harsh, impoverished childhood, which he flaunts. The son of a coal miner who did not finish eighth grade and an immigrant mother from Slovenia, he grew up in Cumming, Iowa, population 139, in a two-bedroom house without hot running water and a proper furnace. His mother died when he was a boy; his father died of black-lung disease. His brother Frank went deaf at the age of 9. "I came from the wrong side of the tracks," Harkin says proudly.</p><p>Actually, there is only one side of the tracks in Cumming, now virtually a suburb of Des Moines. Most of the people who live there are Harkins, or related to them. A totally Roman Catholic enclave, Cumming, founded in 1888, is the kind of town where lawn statues of the Virgin Mary vie for space with those of Mickey Mouse. There are only two streets in town; the school closed down years ago, and there is no longer a local grocery store. The busiest spot in town is the tavern.</p><p>What one neighbor, Ruth Knosby, remembers is his determination, even as a young boy. "Tom used to work for us pitching hay," she recounted. "The family always needed money. One day I looked out the window and saw young Tom standing atop a truckload of hay, catching the bales. All of a sudden, he lost his balance and fell -- it must have been more than 20 feet. He was all white and really had the breath knocked out of him. But when I suggested he rest and call it a day, he flatly refused. He jumped back up on that truck and finished the working day. That's Tom."</p><p>After his mother died, Harkin, an altar boy, went to Dowling Catholic High School in Des Moines and won a Navy R.O.T.C. scholarship to college. As a Navy pilot, he ferried supplies and planes between Japan and Vietnam. Contrary to some statements early in his political career, he never saw combat. And his early criticism of the Vietnam War and American foreign policy in general led Barry Goldwater and others to complain that he had fabricated, or at least exaggerated, his war record.</p><p>Harkin cites as his proud est legislative accomplishment the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which guarantees some 43 million disabled Americans freedom from employment and housing discrimination. On the floor of the Senate, Harkin delivered part of his impassioned speech for the bill in sign language -- a special message to his brother.</p><p>In this campaign, Harkin has faced frequent accusations of being long on rhetoric and short on substance. Critics note that he has yet to provide the kind of detailed plan for national health care that Bob Kerrey and Paul Tsongas have proposed. Is Harkin's reluctance to offer a specific plan for the comprehensive health care he advocates related to his base in Iowa, home of some of the nation's largest insurance companies, many of which oppose publicly financed national care and which contribute heavily through political action committees to his campaign?</p><p>"No," the Senator says calmly. "I haven't done so because I'm not smart enough or knowledgeable enough to put together such a plan. I'm not a health-care specialist. What I've done is outline objectives that any system should meet. It's the job of a President to provide leadership -- to get the specialists in a room and tell them to devise a workable plan -- and to get that plan enacted within a year."</p><p>Harkin instinctively recoils from Clinton's turgid recitation of Census Bureau statistics, from Kerrey's penchant for autobiography, from Tsongas's pessimism and little gray guide to reindustrializing America. His is a world not of complex, international problems but of good guys and bad guys, of the long-suffering poor and the greedy, undeserving rich. All that is required, Harkin maintains, is a leader strong enough to give the Government back to the people. That does not necessarily mean spending more money, he says repeatedly. "The B-2 bomber was a huge public-works program," Harkin says, "but what has the average American gotten out of it?"</p><p>Besides comprehensive health and day care, he favors a national youth corps that would enable every qualified young American to attend college; extended unemployment benefits; national job retraining for victims of technological obsolescence, and $35 billion worth of infrastructure investment in his first year of office. All this can be financed, he claims, through defense cuts and by eliminating Government waste and corruption -- an assertion critics contest.</p><p>"Tom Harkin is the real McCoy, a true populist," says Erwin Knoll, editor of The Progressive Magazine, the nation's second-oldest political magazine, founded by another prairie populist, (Fighting) Bob LaFollette. "But I'm not sure the Democratic Party is populist any longer. The Democrats have moved so far to the right. They've marginalized people like Harkin."</p><p>WILLIAM SCHNEIDER, A political analyst at the Washington-based American Enterprise Institute, insists that there is still a vast potential audience for what Harkin is saying. According to a Time magazine-CNN poll last month, 55 percent of Democrats and independents who leaned toward the Democratic Party said they would support a candidate who favors "traditional Democratic goals of helping people through Government programs." By contrast, only 38 percent said they would prefer a candidate who espoused "limited and less costly Government programs."</p><p>But so far, Tom Harkin does not seem to have reached or convinced this audience. That, according to some analysts, is because of flaws in the messenger, not the message. While Harkin's flamboyant style, his salty, down-home, Trumanesque "plain talk" and even his highly personal attacks on George Bush may have won him applause on the stump early in his campaign, they don't play well on national television. "Americans have enormous respect for the office of the Presidency. They don't want to see their President as foulmouthed, as a guy yelling a barnyard profanity as Harkin did from the podium," says Schneider. Americans, apparently, despite their jokes about George Bush's convoluted speech, would really prefer to hear their Presidents say "doo-doo."</p><p>In focus group after focus group, Harkin gets higher negative ratings than the other candidates. Ann F. Lewis, former political director of the Democratic National Committee and now an independent analyst, says the often humorous but sometimes vulgar talk is partly responsible.</p><p>Harkin's new television ads, the first of which shows excerpts from a stem-winding oration on the campaign trail, have also come in for criticism. "It's just too hot for television," says Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. The second ad, in which a more subdued Harkin softly delivers his message to a nonvisible interviewer, also falls flat, Jamieson says. "We call his more subdued effort the 'tie in the crotch' ad," she says. "Because what people mentioned was not what he said, but that tie dangling between his knees."</p><p>Some argue that Harkin's campaign was also hurt by the man-of-the-people's retreat from New Hampshire over the Christmas holidays to his family vacation home in the Bahamas. Others say that his staff lacks sufficient experience in national political races, and that he started his radio and television advertising far too late. There also seems little doubt that Harkin has paid a price for not cultivating close friends and champions in the news media and the professional political fraternity.</p><p>By all accounts, the Harkins, along with their two daughters, Amy, 15, and Jenny, 10, are a close-knit and private family. Harkin appears to prefer the company of his children to that of political and media celebrities. But his social aloofness has fostered the impression that he is testy, arrogant and hard to get along with.</p><p>"In Iowa, he is more respected for his voting record than liked," says David A. Yepsen, chief political correspondent for The Des Moines Register. "Most people feel they would rather vote for him than have dinner with him."</p><p>For all Harkin's philosophical consistency and eloquent conviction, there are a lot of Democrats, even in Iowa, who simply don't care much for him. While those who know and like him describe him as an honest, tough-minded and very decent man, Harkin often comes across to those who don't know him as sour and small, as the man who shows up to repair your washing machine. Not Presidential.</p><p>Some party officials still contend that Mario Cuomo could have delivered a version of Harkin's message with far greater credibility and effectiveness. "Mario is, well, Presidential," says one Democratic official. "And Harkin just isn't."</p><p>But others in the party disagree. The problem, they say, is not the messenger or his delivery. The problem is the message itself, particularly in New Hampshire, among the nation's most conservative states.</p><p>"The message plays well in Iowa because it comes from there and because Iowans are old," says Yepsen, pointing out that the state is demographically the third-oldest in the country. The average Iowa voter is more than 50. The average age of New Hampshire voters, by contrast, is almost five years younger.</p><p>Since he declared for the Presidency, Harkin has tended to attract older crowds than either Kerrey, 48, or Clinton, 45. Even the candidates' music reflects a generation gap. Harkin kicked off his campaign to the strains of country music from a local Iowa band, while Kerrey initiated his to Bruce Springsteen's "Born to Run." And while the age difference among them is not that great, Harkin comes across, as does Paul Tsongas, as far older, from another generation.</p><p>During a recent campaign stop at a high school in Dover, N.H., the eyes of the student body collectively glazed over as Harkin recounted the glorious achievements of his Democratic forefathers -- Roosevelt, Truman and Kennedy. "Who's Truman?" one gum-chewing blonde asked her girlfriend.</p><p>"The audience for Harkin's message is literally and figuratively dying," says Mike McCurry, the senior communications adviser to Kerrey. "It's just not appealing to the baby boomers, the geodemographic bulge that accounted for the Republican ascendancy of the 80's and that might signal a new Democratic resurgence in the 90's. These are people with virtually no party affiliations. The imagery of Roosevelt's New Deal simply does not resonate with them."</p><p>Because Iowans know their home-grown populism when they hear it, they are also less likely than most Americans to mistake it for the dreaded Northeastern liberalism. "I think part of the reason that Harkin doesn't seem to be catching on," says Peter Fenn, a Washington-based independent political consultant, "is that people in New Hampshire don't see Harkin as a populist, but as a knee-jerk, dyed-in-the-wool, big-spending liberal."</p><p>The subtle but critical difference between Harkin's populist message and standard liberalism -- his emphasis not so much on expanding Government programs, which all the candidates favor to some degree, but on class warfare -- is all but lost on most voters.</p><p>When Harkin speaks, what comes across is the big "L" word, as Jamieson puts it, which is particularly disabling in New Hampshire, home of John H. Sununu and a license plate that reads "Live Free or Die." Polls show that across the country five times the number of people surveyed think that liberal is a dirty word rather than a positive one. But the ratio is 13 to 1 in New Hampshire. "Liberal there is tantamount to sodomy," Jamieson says.</p><p>Moreover, while Harkin identifies himself as the only real Democrat in the race, 45 percent of those who voted in the New Hampshire Democratic primary in 1984 and 1988 identified themselves as independents or Republicans, says Stan B. Greenberg, a poll taker for Clinton. This was particularly true of younger voters. "So he's running as a real Democrat when 45 percent of the electorate by definition doesn't care," he says.</p><p>Harkin argues that while New Hampshire Republicans may be more conservative than their counterparts in other states, the state's Democrats are not. Former United States Representative John Durkin, the co-chair of Harkin's New Hampshire campaign, agreed. "In 1988, New Hampshire would have elected Jack the Ripper if he were a Republican," he says. "But in 1992, the 'L' word stands for only two things: 'laid off' or 'losing my job.' " Much of the state's high-tech industry has been ravaged by the recession; some 50,000 jobs have left the state; five of the largest banks have folded; personal bankruptcies rose an estimated 75 percent last year, and even the state chairman of the Democratic Party, Chris Spirou, is in danger of having his home mortgage foreclosed.</p><p>Despite the intense voter anger, alienation and economic misery, concerns about Harkin's message have surfaced repeatedly. In January, Susan Vallone Joyce, a Harkin supporter, invited 35 neighbors to her home in Epping to meet the Iowa Senator. (She also invited Clinton, but was told that the Governor would not attend any function that could not guarantee a crowd of at least 100.) After Harkin left, several people said that although they liked him and found much of what he had to say appealing, they feared that higher taxes would be required to pay for the ambitious Federal projects he had outlined. "I don't think pulling our troops out of Europe is going to be enough to finance all those programs," Mark Kucera, an independent, said afterwards. Bonnie M. Meroth, a freelance journalist and marketing consultant in New Hampshire, had similar fears. "The ideas are terrific and he expresses them well, but who is going to fund these enormously expensive programs?"</p><p>Paradoxically, Harkin's populist razzmatazz might have been more appealing to Democrats when President Bush was soaring in the polls and the party had little to lose by nominating a candidate who reflected its conscience and tradition. "The Bush bashing and the old-time Democratic religion worked better when it stirred people's memories and seemed a healthy nostalgic indulgence," says Schneider. But as Bush started falling in the polls and the Democrats smelled possible Republican defeat, the party leadership began looking for a more electable candidate.</p><p>A bitter reality for Harkin is that his message may be working far more than his competitors care to admit -- but not for him. Robert Kuttner, a writer who specializes in economic issues, argues that the most appealing themes of Harkin's populism are turning up more frequently in the speeches of the other candidates.</p><p>But Harkin's words in the mouth of Bill Clinton or Bob Kerrey come across differently. "When you hear Harkin talk about investment in infrastructure," says Greenberg, "you automatically think brick and mortar and construction jobs. But New Hampshire is very suburban, so a message that comes across as blue-collar working-class doesn't work."</p><p>Kevin Phillips, the Republican political analyst Harkin most admires, agrees. Phillips has argued that Republicans will eventually pay for their policies of the 1980's, which produced extraordinary concentrations of wealth at the top of society and neglected the middle class. But Harkin has not got his message across, Phillips contends, because "prairie populism has little resonance among the middle-class inhabitants of the cities and suburbs, where most Americans now live," he says. "Harkin doesn't talk to George Wallace country, or to people in Silicon Valley, or to people with low-paying jobs in Syosset, L.I."</p><p>Harris Wofford's stunning upset in Pennsylvania's Senate race in November showed that a more polished middle-class version of Tom Harkin, coupled with a populist and protectionist message, can win. What is needed, says Phillips, "is a populist message grafted onto a basically middle-class appeal" -- middle-class populism, in other words.</p><p>Harkin asserts that the leaders of his party are simply not as responsive to his message as rank-and-file Democrats. But some labor leaders who would normally be supporting Harkin overwhelmingly, given his solid union credentials, are leaning toward Clinton's more moderate, pro-business message.</p><p>Again, electability is the key. Gerald W. McEntee, international president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, recently praised Clinton, despite the Arkansas Governor's often-fractious relations with public employees in his own state. "I knew we could get 90 percent of our agenda with Tom Harkin and only about 60 to 65 percent with Clinton," says McEntee. "But with George Bush we would get only single digits. So because our people are hurting, gaining the White House is critical to me."</p><p>He loved the Senator's message, McEntee added, "but Harkin's speech is the speech I give, and I can't be elected President."</p><p>Jeff Faux, president of the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, a liberal think tank with ties to labor, says the Democratic Party is suffering from a debilitating lack of self-confidence that works against candidates of conscience like Harkin. "Tom Harkin looks like a Democrat and sounds like a Democrat and makes the faithful feel like Democrats, so there must be something wrong with him, they think," Faux says.</p><p>A succession of Democratic losses in Presidential bids has created what he calls "the Groucho Marx syndrome" within the party -- "the feeling that any club that would have us as members can't be worth joining."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-contributor" style="" class="mod-nytimescontributor"><!-- Module starts: contributor (Contributor) -->Judith Miller is the staff writer for The New York Times Magazine.<!-- Module ends: contributor--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
