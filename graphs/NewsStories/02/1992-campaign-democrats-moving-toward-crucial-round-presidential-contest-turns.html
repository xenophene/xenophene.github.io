"I am tired of what is coldbloodedness being passed off as courage," Mr. Clinton added, referring to Mr. Tsongas's claim to be the economic truth-teller in the race.</p><p>One of the key points of distinction between the two men is their stance on a tax cut for the middle class. Mr. Clinton supports it as a matter of fairness, while Mr. Tsongas opposes it, saying it might be good politics but calling it a bad policy that will not help the economy or curb the deficit.</p><p>Mr. Tsongas, campaigning in Denver, shot back, in what seemed like a reference to Mr. Clinton's draft record, "Is Bill Clinton now our resident expert on courage?" Kerrey on Clinton</p><p>Mr. Kerrey was in Florida today, trying to keep alive his dispute with Mr. Clinton over the latter's draft status during the Vietnam War. "I've tried to be sympathetic with Bill Clinton's problems, and all the other Americans who made the decision in conscience not to go to Vietnam in the 60's," said Mr. Kerrey, who lost part of his leg in Vietnam and won the Medal of Honor there. "It was a difficult time. But I find myself not believing that he really wanted to get in, but couldn't."</p><p>Mr. Kerrey, who has used the draft issue to attack Mr. Clinton's ability to beat Mr. Bush in the general election, added, "Electability was a question that Bill Clinton raised. I'm now saying on that question what everybody privately is saying."</p><p>Mr. Clinton has denied accusations that he sought to avoid the draft, but Mr. Kerrey and others have questioned his account that in the fall of 1969 he made himself eligible for the draft and did not try to manipulate the system to avoid it.</p><p>Today, Mr. Clinton chastised Mr. Kerrey and asserted the Nebraskan was questioning his patriotism. "I love my country," he said. "I love and support the idea that people are willing to serve it in uniform." The Jesse Jackson Issue</p><p>The pressurized atmosphere led, inevitably, to the kind of stumble Mr. Clinton made Wednesday night that brought him into conflict with Mr. Jackson.</p><p>The Arkansas Governor, who was giving a series of interviews to local television stations, was asked by a reporter about Mr. Jackson's campaigning in South Carolina with Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa Mr. Clinton apparently and mistakenly understood this to mean that Mr. Jackson had endorsed Senator Harkin. Between interviews, in remarks that the Governor did not know were picked up by a waiting crew -- and which were later broadcast by a Phoenix, Ariz., television station -- a furious Mr. Clinton told his aide, "It's an outrage, it's a dirty, double-crossing, back-stabbing thing to do."</p><p>Mr. Clinton called Mr. Jackson to smooth things over today and later announced, "It's fine between us." Perhaps equally important, Mr. Clinton was in Atlanta today picking up the endorsement of Mayor Maynard Jackson, a formidable power in the region and a longtime ally of Jesse Jackson.In a statement today, Jesse Jackson, who accrued significant power in the Democratic Party with his past two drives for the nomination, seemed not entirely mollified.</p><p>He said he remained open to "offer advice and counsel to all of the campaigns," that he was "disappointed" by Mr. Clinton's remarks and that a meeting was in order. Still, the statement seemed more muscle-flexing than high pique, by Jackson standards.</p><p>Given the mood of the day, however, it did not take Mr. Tsongas long to try to turn Mr. Clinton's outburst about Mr. Jackson against the Governor from Arkansas.</p><p>Initially, Mr. Tsongas had to prompt reporters to ask him about the incident. After fielding several questions from local reporters in Seattle about his policies on bicycles and the spotted owl, Mr. Tsongas bluntly said: "Is someone going to ask me about the Reverend Jackson issue or should I just expound on my own?"</p><p>"I think the American people want a President who's cool under fire," Mr. Tsongas said once he got the question he wanted. "And that kind of instinctive, angry, emotional outburst, I don't think is appropriate." He added that the Clinton outburst "gave the American people a pretty good look into what a person does under stress."</p><p>Senator Harkin, meanwhile, asserted, "Do we want as a President someone who on the basis of a rumor flies off at the handle, vehemently making statements on the basis of a rumor?"</p><p>Mr. Tsongas, who held a news conference in Denver this morning and traveled to Seattle later in the day, joined the crowd trying to cast themselves as the most "electable" candidate in the field, which is becoming the buzz word among Democrats who see a new vulnerability in President Bush this fall, and fear that their party will not exploit it.</p><p>Mr. Tsongas's differences with his party were on full display today, however, as he called on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to stop running advertisements advocating a middle-class tax cut, which the Democratic leadership supports and Mr. Tsongas does not. A spokeswoman for the campaign committee said the advertisements were aimed at Mr. Bush, not Mr. Tsongas.</p><p>The Clinton campaign clearly hopes to make Mr. Tsongas's economic policies a vulnerability as the race moves toward more blue-collar areas. Mr. Clinton asserted today that Mr. Tsongas lacked a true understanding of the human side of the nation's problems.</p><p>"I believe that a President is more than an economic mechanic pushing buttons and pulling levers," Mr. Clinton said. "I reject that cramped and limited view of the Presidency. Franklin Roosevelt didn't get this country off its back by saying the only thing we have to fear is a lack of venture capital."</p><p>Mayor Jackson of Atlanta used his news conference with Mr. Clinton today to chide Democrats for attacking one another. "Please let's not end up with a nominee who is attacked by the other candidates and therefore is weakened when the time comes to take the fight to George Bush," the mayor said.</p><p>This was not, however, the theme of the day.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
