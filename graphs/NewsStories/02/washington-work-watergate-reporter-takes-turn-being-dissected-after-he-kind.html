Broder, set out last year to learn everything they could about the Vice President, Washington awaited bombshells. But when the authors published their book-length series last month in The Washington Post, there were not any.</p><p>The seven-part series, which ended on Jan. 12, presented Mr. Quayle as a largely misunderstood figure who, for whatever his shortcomings, is a skilled political strategist, a fierce competitor and an effective agent of President Bush's efforts to curb Government regulation of business.</p><p>The resulting criticism in the journalism world left Mr. Woodward puzzled and Mr. Quayle's aides gleeful. Newsweek said the articles provided a "New Boost for Quayle." Time argued that the articles were "scarcely laying a kid glove on Dan." Dan Rather said in a CBS radio broadcast that the articles were "so complimentary to Quayle that they could have been written by the Bush-Quayle re-election team."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-first-para--></div><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ln-ctr-top" style="" class="mod-nytimesline mod-line"><!-- Module starts: ln-ctr-top (Line) --><center><div style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc; height:1px; width:350px;"></div></center><!-- Module ends: ln-ctr-top--></div><!-- Area starts: main-center-center --><div id="area-main-center-center" style=""><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ctr-lt-in-top" style="float:left;" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-lt-in-top (AdCpc) -->

Nixon, as familiar as anyone with Mr. Woodward's Watergate reporting, found the Quayle pieces so sympathetic that he has refused to take them at face value, telling people that Mr. Woodward must be trying to build up Mr. Quayle for the 1996 Presidential nomination in the belief that a Democrat could beat him. Campaign Promoters</p><p>Even The Washington Post began reporting on The Washington Post, noting that critics, including many inside the paper, were calling the series "too soft" and that Bush-Quayle campaign aides were distributing it in New Hampshire.</p><p>Whatever its effect on Mr. Quayle, the series, and the reaction to it, goes to the heart of Mr. Woodward's remarkable influence on journalism. With his Watergate partner, Carl Bernstein, Mr. Woodward inspired a generation of journalists with his investigations of the powerful.</p><p>With that image still in mind, some people who have followed Mr. Woodward's work have looked at the Quayle series and wondered if two decades of fame and fortune have lessened the skepticism he brings to those in power.</p><p>But many of those who know him well say Mr. Woodward has long been a misunderstood figure, subjected to unrealistic expectations. While he came to fame for helping to bring down an Administration, they say, he has never been a counter-establishment figure in the style of earlier muckrakers like Lincoln Steffens or I. F. Stone. Myth vs. Reality</p><p>Mr. Woodward's post-Watergate books -- especially those that portray the inner workings of the Central Intelligence Agency and the top military command -- have been remarkable not for their criticism of the world of power but for their access to it.</p><p>If the Quayle series shows anything, some of Mr. Woodward's friends say, it may be that there have always been two Bob Woodwards: the mythological giant-killer portrayed by Robert Redford in the movie "All the President's Men," and the actual reporter.</p><p>In a recent interview at his Georgetown home, the 48-year-old Mr. Woodward, whose best-selling books have earned him a fortune, presented himself as something he says he has always been: a simple gatherer of facts. "Whoever said I was a moral critic?" he said. "All I've ever said is that I tried to be a reporter and a writer and try to find out what's going on."</p><p>"Hungry?" he asked of himself, sounding pained that anyone could think he was otherwise. "An incredible amount of work went into this, and I've had friends say to me, 'Why do you still do these things? It can't be easy.' I spent a lot of times getting up at 5 o'clock in the morning."</p><p>Referring to the Vice President, Mr. Woodward said his "skepticism was, and is, very great about him or anybody else I write about."</p><p>Mr. Bernstein, now a correspondent at Time magazine, praised the series and said its critics were motivated by "plain jealousy." 'Indefatigable Energy'</p><p>Mr. Broder, co-author of the Quayle series, said Mr. Woodward still possessed "tremendous, indefatigable energy," which, combined with his willingness to reinterview sources continually, caused their candor to increase "exponentially."</p><p>David Beckwith, the Vice President's press secretary, said he had a few quibbles with the series. But after years of trying to persuade journalists to cover Mr. Quayle at length, he said, he did not want to appear "an ingrate."</p><p>Much like Mr. Quayle, Mr. Woodward comes from a prominent Midwestern family. The son of a judge in Wheaton, Ill., he attended Yale University and served as a Navy officer before joining The Washington Post in 1971. He was a registered Republican at the time he was breaking Watergate.</p><p>Mr. Woodward is offended by corruption but not by the political status quo, said Scott Armstrong, a high school friend who worked with Mr. Woodward on his books, "The Final Days" (Simon & Schuster, 1976) and "The Brethren: Inside the Supreme Court" (Simon & Schuster, 1979).</p><p>"There are many journalists who really do have a burning desire to change the way society functions," Mr. Armstrong said. "Woodward has been put at the top of that branch of journalism. That was a misnomer. He never was in that branch of journalism." 'Less Overtly Skeptical'</p><p>Mr. Armstrong argues that criticism of the Quayle series has more to do with unrealistic expectations than real shortcomings.</p><p>"People expected when he cut open the carcass, he'd find some rotten organs and expose them," he said. "He just did a biopsy and said, 'This is how a liver works.' "</p><p>But Mr. Armstrong added that he does think Mr. Woodward's articles "are less overtly skeptical" than they once were. "Woodward is much more likely, particularly in the last decade or so, to let people speak for themselves," he said. "He thinks people are acquitted or convicted on their own testimony."</p><p>After his 1987 book on the Central Intelligence Agency, "Veil" (Simon & Schuster), some critics said Mr. Woodward had been co-opted by William J. Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence at the time, and fed small stories to divert him from the larger Iran-contra scandal.</p><p>Mr. Woodward himself reflected openly on the question in a 1989 Playboy interview by the author J. Anthony Lukas.</p><p>"I failed and I should have got it and I am really critical of myself," Mr. Woodward said in the Playboy interview, speaking of the Iran-contra affair. "He knew about it and he didn't tell me. So was I being co-opted? I don't know."</p><p>In the same interview Mr. Woodward said he was better at collecting facts than he was at analyzing them, an analysis that some critics say was borne out by the Quayle series. "I am just not capable -- and this is a grave fault -- of taking A, B, C, and D and saying, "O.K., now E," he said.</p><p>When "The Commanders," Mr. Woodward's book on military decision making, was published last year by Simon & Schuster, some critics questioned whether he had relied too heavily on the perspective of Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. When a Senate panel grilled General Powell on his role in the book, the chairman called Mr. Woodward "a friend." Reporting Technique Changes</p><p>Mr. Lukas, who said he admires much of Mr. Woodward's work, agrees that Mr. Woodward was never a counter-establishment figure. But Mr. Lukas sees a change in reporting technique from Watergate, when he said Mr. Woodward relied more heavily on lower-level aides and clerks.</p><p>"I'm sure Bob realizes this," he said, "but his increasing dependence on access to very powerful people necessarily raises questions about whether he is serving the interests of his sources more than those of the public."</p><p>Mary McGrory, a liberal columnist for The Washington Post, also sees a change in perspective. "He's arrived and arrived and arrived," she said. "And when you've arrived, you don't have to growl and chew quite so much."</p><p>During Watergate, Mr. Woodward's editors fielded angry telephone calls from complaining officials. Last month, however, it was Mr. Woodward who placed one after saying in an on-the-record interview for this article that he would call a reporter's boss to say that questions to him and others had been "unpleasant" and "insulting."</p><p>The Quayle series does present material that is unflattering to the Quayles. One of the most vivid scenes shows Marilyn Quayle, the Vice President's wife, pitching a fit and tearing up an unflattering picture of her husband. Another shows Mr. Quayle being unable to remember virtually anything about a book he had described as important in shaping his thinking.</p><p>The authors call Mr. Quayle a "man of average gifts and modest vision" and quote Senator Warren B. Rudman, an influential New Hampshire Republican, who argues that Mr. Quayle lacks the "moral authority" to be President.</p><p>But there are also times when Mr. Woodward seems more accepting of officials' perspective than he was during Watergate, when he was careful to note that officials who called his articles "a collection of absurdities" were not denying them.</p><p>In an article about Mr. Quayle's passion for golf, for instance, the authors spend one paragraph on criticisms that the game occupies too much of the Vice President's time. They go on to quote at length Mrs. Quayle, a Quayle friend and two Quayle aides, who present the game as a metaphor for the Vice President's competitive spirit.</p><p>The series is similarly passive when Mr. Quayle boasts of preventing what he calls "regulatory creep" from infecting the Administration. The authors fail to note that despite the Vice President's intervention in a few important areas, regulatory activity, for better or worse, has surged.</p><p>Mr. Woodward's admirers say the nonjudgmental approach helps him gain access to councils of power, giving readers new information they can use to draw their own conclusions.</p><p>"If you look at his work carefully, especially the books, there is very little in there that is hard-edged investigative journalism," said one admirer of the Quayle series, Steve Weinberg, former director of Investigative Reporters and Editors, a professional association. "And there's a lot in there that is essentially a transmission belt for the establishment point of view. He definitely by temperament is not a bomb-thrower."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
