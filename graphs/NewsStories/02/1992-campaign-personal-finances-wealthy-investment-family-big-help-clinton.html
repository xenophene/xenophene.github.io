He placed calls to members of an influential Arkansas business group, asking them to raise $50,000 for his campaign, according to people involved in the effort.</p><p>"He was somewhat in a panic," recalled Warren A. Stephens, one of those contacted by the Governor.</p><p>Mr. Stephens is president and chief executive officer of Stephens Inc., the investment banking flagship of the Stephens family empire, which has vast holdings in natural gas, finance and real estate. Published estimates of the family's wealth put it well over $1 billion.</p><p>Mr. Stephens and his associates quickly agreed to raise the money, providing the pledges that helped Mr. Clinton get $50,000 from a bank the next day. The money was used for last-minute television advertisements. Thus began an important financial alliance that has helped drive Mr. Clinton's campaign for the Democratic Presidential nomination.</p><p>In the last week of the 1990 campaign, the Clintons took out two personal loans totaling $100,000, to use in the 1990 campaign. The $100,000 notes are due on demand and have not yet been paid back. In its most recent state filings, Mr. Clinton's committee reports that it still owes the money.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-first-para--></div><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ln-ctr-top" style="" class="mod-nytimesline mod-line"><!-- Module starts: ln-ctr-top (Line) --><center><div style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc; height:1px; width:350px;"></div></center><!-- Module ends: ln-ctr-top--></div><!-- Area starts: main-center-center --><div id="area-main-center-center" style=""><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ctr-lt-in-top" style="float:left;" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-lt-in-top (AdCpc) -->

He has spent most of his career in public service, and as Governor he earns only $35,000 a year, plus a little more than $5,000 in honorariums or speaking fees last year. As a result, he has accumlated far fewer assets than his wife, Hillary, a lawyer and senior partner in the Rose law firm in Little Rock.</p><p>Mrs. Clinton has had connections to the Stephenses, too. According to a Stephens official who asked not to be identified, Mrs. Clinton once represented them in litigation. Public records also show that her firm has represented a number of Stephens entities.</p><p>Mrs. Clinton's career has produced most of the family's wealth. She is not required to disclose her income, and Mrs. Clinton would not answer questions on the subject. But press reports in Arkansas, based on the Clintons' tax returns, said her law firm salary for 1989 was $92,000. The couple's net worth is between $350,000 and $1 million, according to Mr. Clinton's report to the Federal Election Commission, which requires only that assets and liabilities be listed in ranges. Broad Financial Support</p><p>Their holdings include bank accounts, bonds, mutual funds and investment partnerships. The largest asset is Mrs. Clinton's share of her firm's profit sharing and retirment plan, valued between $100,001 and $250,000.</p><p>Mrs. Clinton co-signed two bank notes when her husband borrowed $100,000 for his last campaign from a small bank whose chairman used to head the state Democratic Party, according to public records. But as a Presidential candidate, the Governor has successfully raised campaign money from a broad range of business interests and individuals.</p><p>Mr. Clinton does not accept contributions from political action committees, so loans and fund-raising efforts offered by people like the Stephenses are all the more important.</p><p>No one is suggesting wrongdoing in the Stephens-Clinton connection. But it is a vivid example of the sorts of enduring political relationships that enable a small-state politician like Mr. Clinton to become a contender in the campaign for the nomination. Scores of $1,000 Donors</p><p>The Stephenses and their associates have raised more than $100,000 for Mr. Clinton's Presidential campaign so far, soliciting donations from scores of business associates and friends who each contributed up to $1,000, the maximum allowed under Federal laws.</p><p>Among these Stephens associates is Curt Bradbury, a former employee of Stephens Inc., who is now the chief executive of Worthen National Bank of Arkansas and its parent, the Worthen Banking Corporation, in which the Stephens family owns a 38 percent interest. Last month, the Worthen National Bank approved a credit line that allows the Clinton campaign to borrow up to $2 million.</p><p>The Stephens group's investment firm is one of the nation's largest. Arkansas state auditors have criticized some of its financial dealings with the state, and some critics have complained that the Governor has allowed the Stephenses to exercise too much influence over state Government. Ties to Republicans</p><p>In the 1980's, there were few visible financial ties between Governor Clinton and the Stephens family. The Stephenses seemed more closely aligned with the Republicans. Stephens Inc. and its chairman, Jackson T. (Jack) Stephens, donated $100,000 to the national Republican Party both in 1988 and 1991.</p><p>But beginning in 1990, the Stephenses started paying closer attention to the Democratic Governor. Mr. Clinton's Republican opponent that year was a critic of the Stephenses who wanted to reduce their financial dealings and their general influence in the state.</p><p>"I would have brought all this to a halt, the free ride in Arkansas, doing what they wanted with the blessing of the Governor," the losing candidate, Sheffield Nelson, said in an interview. Mr. Nelson is a Little Rock lawyer.</p><p>By the end of last summer, Mr. Clinton's Presidential campaign had raised about $200,000, and Worthen Bank employees were the most frequently identified source of contributions, election records show.</p><p>Since then, the campaign's fund-raising efforts have taken off. Mr. Clinton raised more than $3 million in the last quarter, about one-third of which cames from Arkansas, according to Rahm Emanuel, the national finance director for the Clinton campaign.</p><p>While several Wall Street brokerage houses do business with the State of Arkansas, and their partners also contribute money to Mr. Clinton's campaigns, according to records and businessmen, the state's dealings with the Stephens that "get in the newspaper all the time," as Warren Stephens put it. In his view, the company's influence has made it subject to more attention than is warranted. Warren Stephens, Jack Stephens's son, said Mr. Nelson exaggerates the family's influence.</p><p>The state's auditor, Julia Hughes Jones, opposed two state pension fund investments that Stephens Inc. arranged in 1987 and 1988, noting that Stephens had represented both the bond issuers and the bond purchasers.</p><p>In an interview, Mrs. Jones, who is an elected official, said she believed the Stephenses should have given the pension fund more information about what it was doing. She added that outside advisers should have been brought in. And she complained that the Stephenses' fees were excessive, though Mrs. Jones did support subsequent deals after Stephens lowered its fees.</p><p>Warren Stephens defended the state pension investment deals, saying their "record has been outstanding."</p><p>The trustees of the pension funds, most of them appointed by Mr. Clinton, did agree to the investments, and Mr. Clinton also gave approval.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
