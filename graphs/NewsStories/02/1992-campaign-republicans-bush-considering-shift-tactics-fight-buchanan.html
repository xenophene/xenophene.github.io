The write-ins were not counted on primary night. Counting only Bush and Buchanan votes, the President defeated Mr. Buchanan by 59 percent to 41 percent.</p><p>The results alarmed the White House, but Administration and campaign officials argued that the proper response was to fine-tune and sharpen their political message, and not to make basic policy changes advocated by some Republicans.</p><p>For the Democrats, New Hampshire provided Paul E. Tsongas and Bill Clinton with new credibility and set the stage for a tough nomination struggle, with the candidates forced to spread out and appeal to voters from a broader spectrum. [ Page A21. ] Faith in Economy</p><p>Robert M. Teeter, Mr. Bush's campaign chairman, said, "I'm convinced and the President is convinced that the economy is going to get better in the fall."</p><p>This view received some support today from Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, who said he saw "stirrings" of an economic recovery, and from figures showing that in January, new-home construction reached its briskest pace since May 1990.</p><p>But some disgruntled party regulars complained that Mr. Bush needed an overhaul of both his message and his policies. The campaign's self-inspection, some of which was conducted in public by Mr. Bush himself, reflected broad concerns within the Republican Party about why the President and his high-powered campaign team had stumbled so badly in New Hampshire.</p><p>Republican strategists and campaign officials said Mr. Bush had to go beyond the tactical concern of blunting Mr. Buchanan and find his own voice as the primary campaigns broaden into the South, then the West and then the Midwest, and then for the general election.</p><p>Mr. Bush's effort in New Hampshire to cater to the right wing of the party, salting his essentially moderate policies with conservative social messages and holding his fire to avoid a party rift, clearly did not work, strategists said. They said it would be of even less use as he tried to appeal to a broader section of the party and to conservative Democrats as the campaign goes on.</p><p>The President's own lackluster performance on the stump in New Hampshire also raised questions about the wisdom of basing the campaign's plans on a barnstorming tour of the South that will keep Mr. Bush on the road for most of the next three weeks. Bush's Aloof Stance</p><p>Clearly vexed at Mr. Buchanan's successes in New Hampshire and under pressure from Republican leaders to abandon the aloof stance toward his challenger that had cost him votes there, Mr. Bush today acknowledged that he had allowed himself to "lay back and get hammered" without defending himself.</p><p>Mr. Bush told reporters during a visit to Tennessee, one of 11 states that will hold primaries on March 10, Super Tuesday, that he was eager to "roll up my sleeves and go after" his Republican and Democratic adversaries.</p><p>But he seemed uncertain about how aggressive he was prepared to be to accomplish his current strategic objectives: to lock up the Republican nomination by early May and then to prevent Mr. Buchanan from hanging on long enough to go to the June 2 California primary, where the Bush campaign fears a nomination struggle would hurt Mr. Bush next November in a hard-to-win state.</p><p>"We might have to define the opponent," Mr. Bush said, referring to him by name -- as "Pat" -- for the first time in the campaign and using a common political euphemism for attacking another candidate. "I've been very kind and gentle," Mr. Bush said. "I'll still be kind and I'm now debating how gentle to be."</p><p>One issue that continued to vex the Bush camp was Mr. Buchanan's clear success in New Hampshire with commercials that accused Mr. Bush of abandoning a $500 increase in the tax exemption for children because he did not include it among the seven most urgent measures that he wants passed by March 20.</p><p>But Administration and Congressional officials said that the White House did not plan to revise its seven-point list, worked out after the State of the Union Message, to include the proposal, or to make any other major shift in economic policy.</p><p>"If the message didn't get through, we've got to articulate it better, but fundamentally the message is the same," a top campaign official said today. "It's that he does understand, he had the message long before New Hampshire, that we've got some economic problems in the country that are severe."</p><p>Bush aides contend that voters were angrier in New Hampshire because its economic situation was especially bad and that voter dissatisfaction in general is not with Mr. Bush personally, but with the Federal Government as a whole.</p><p>"I think people feel that the economy is poised for recovery," Mr. Bush said. 'The Gloves Are Off'</p><p>Campaign officials said today Mr. Bush's spokesmen would have a freer hand in criticizing Mr. Buchanan. "I think it's fair to say that the gloves are off," said Charles Black, senior adviser to the Bush campaign.</p><p>He added: "Pat made a good showing and he deserves attention, but we know from a lot of history that heavy negatives, not responded to, cost you a lot of votes, and we won't let him get away with that again. We will be discussing some of the issues he's interested in, such as isolationism and protectionism."</p><p>A senior Bush campaign official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, focused on Mr. Buchanan's opposition to the war in the Persian Gulf.</p><p>"If he wants to debate whether or not the war was a good idea, if he wants to debate whether going into Kuwait or not was a good idea and having Desert Storm, which he didn't support, was a good idea, fine," he said. "We'll debate that with him."</p><p>Mr. Bush himself made some indirect swipes at Mr. Buchanan. Asked by reporters in Knoxville, Tenn., how he would define the differences between himself and his challenger, Mr. Bush pushed one of the hottest political buttons there is: Social Security.</p><p>"Well, I don't think Social Security ought to be voluntary," Mr. Bush said. "That's the Bush position."</p><p>Asked about Mr. Bush's remark, Mr. Buchanan said, "I wouldn't touch Social Security." Asked whether he had ever advocated changing Social Security, he said: "I don't know what I wrote 27 years ago. They are probably digging through the files."</p><p>The Bush campaign said the reference came from a 1983 syndicated column in which Mr. Buchanan wrote: "Why not make Social Security voluntary? For black Americans and all Americans. Why not allow young black and white workers to opt out, on condition that they set aside -- in Individual Retirement Accounts -- amounts equal to what they would have given in to Social Security?" How Hard to Fight</p><p>But when it came to attacking Mr. Buchanan directly, Mr. Bush pulled his punches today. Officials were still debating how aggressive Mr. Bush should be, as well as whether to use negative television commercials like one that was prepared for New Hamsphire but never broadcast.</p><p>In New Hampshire, Mr. Bush held his fire out of fear of dividing the party. But Mr. Black suggested that the campaign was willing to take that risk for the short-term goal of eliminating Mr. Buchanan. "We'll get the party together," he said. "It just might take us a little longer."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
