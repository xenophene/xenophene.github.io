Eugene Holmes of the Army to explain why he had decided not to join the university's R.O.T.C. program. When Mr. Clinton agreed to join the program, Colonel Holmes requested that Mr. Clinton be reclassified from 1-A, immediately eligible for the draft, to 1-D, the category for men who joined the reserves or student R.O.T.C. units</p><p>In the letter, Mr. Clinton described what he said today was a snapshot of that generation's feelings. The letter shows that the candidate, like thousands of men in his generation, actually opposed both the war and the draft and viewed the R.O.T.C. program mainly as a way of staying out of combat without breaking the law. [ Text of letter, page A25. ]</p><p>In tones of moral anguish, Mr. Clinton wrote about his role in organizing anti-war rallies in the United States and Britain, where he was studying in 1969 as a Rhodes Scholar. He stated that he admired friends who had defied the Selective Service law, but did not want to break the law himself and damage his career and "political viability."</p><p>"First, I want to thank you, not just for saving me from the draft, but for being so kind and decent to me last summer, when I was as low as I have ever been," Mr. Clinton wrote.</p><p>"One thing which made the bond we struck in good faith somewhat palatable to me was my high regard for you personally," Mr. Clinton wrote. "In retrospect, it seems that the admiration might not have been mutual had you known a little more about me, about my political beliefs and activities. At least you might have thought me more fit for the draft than for R.O.T.C."</p><p>Last week, fending off questions about his draft deferment, Mr. Clinton said, "You've got to understand that if you look at the facts as they then existed, instead of some 23-year-later rewrite, the facts are, I put myself into the draft, I didn't take it out." Issue Is Revived</p><p>The question of Mr. Clinton's draft status was revived as an issue last Thursday when The Wall Street Journal reported that in 1969 Mr. Clinton secured a draft deferment by promising to join the R.O.T.C. program supervised by Colonel Holmes and enroll in the University of Arkansas Law School. Instead, he attended Oxford University for a second year then went to law school at Yale University.</p><p>Mr. Clinton admitted last week that he had done that, but denied any intention to mislead Colonel Holmes or the local draft board in his hometown, Hope, Ark. He also insisted that he had acted in good faith and later asked to have his R.O.T.C. deferment revoked because he felt a moral obligation to submit to the draft. "I had four of my high school classmates killed in Vietnam," he explained last week, "and I just didn't feel right about it."</p><p>The letter released today showed that Mr. Clinton actually signed a letter of intent to join the R.O.T.C., rather than simply making a verbal promise. It also suggested that he knew he was misleading Colonel Holmes about true feelings about the war and the Army when the two men had talked during the summer of 1969. In the letter he wrote of "loathing the military to which you and other good man have devoted years." Colonel Holmes has not been available for comment on the letter.</p><p>It was a time of growing discontent with the war, with President Nixon and, at times, with authority. College students and many Democratic politicians worked that year to fan such sentiments. A high point came on Oct. 16 when millions of Americans across a broad spectrum of society wore black armbands, held prayer vigils, chanted at rallies and stayed away from classes or jobs in a protest they called the Vietnam Moratorium. 'No Interest in R.O.T.C.'</p><p>"After I signed the R.O.T.C. letter of intent," he continued in the letter, "I began to wonder whether the compromise I had made with myself was not more objectionable than the draft would have been, because I had no interest in the R.O.T.C. program in itself and all I seemed to have done was to protect myself from physical harm.</p><p>"Also, I began to think I had deceived you, not by lies -- there were none -- but by failing to tell you all the things I'm writing now. I doubt that I had the mental coherence to articulate them then."</p><p>Mr. Clinton went on to describe how his moral torment kept him from sleeping and how on Sept. 12, 1969, he wrote but never mailed a letter telling his draft board to re-classify him as 1-A. He added, "I didn't mail the letter because I didn't see, in the end, how my going in the Army and maybe going to Vietnam would achieve anything except a feeling that I had punished myself and gotten what I deserved."</p><p>On Oct. 31, 1969, Colonel Holmes had him re-classified after being told by Mr. Clinton that he would not attend the University of Arkansas. But by that time, Mr. Clinton had been exempted during September and October, when according to The Wall Street Journal he had been informed by the local draft board that he faced the greatest chance of being drafted. Sequence Seen as Chance</p><p>On Sept. 19, 1969, President Nixon announced a 50,000-man reduction in the draft call for the rest of the year and ruled that the October draft call of 29,000 would be spaced out over the final three months of the year. On Dec. 1, 1969, the draft lottery was held and Mr. Clinton drew the number 311, meaning he was no longer in jeopardy. Mr. Clinton said today that he "presumed" he must have known about the lottery drawing when he wrote the letter to Colonel Holmes.</p><p>Appearing on the ABC News program "Nightline," tonight, Mr. Clinton acknowledged that his draft lottery number had been drawn on Dec. 1, that he had sent in an application to law school at Yale University on Dec. 2 and that he had written the letter to Colonel Holmes on Dec. 3.</p><p>But he denied that the sequence of his actions implied that he was by then confident that he had escaped the draft. Mr. Clinton also emphasized that at his deferment had been revoked and that he had been returned to the draft pool several weeks before the December actions. He added that the two people most directly involved in the change of his deferment were his stepfather and the head of his draft board, both now dead.</p><p>Also on "Nightline," Mr. Clinton added that he was seeking to get past the "cloud" which has all but obscured the economic message he said he was trying to send to New Hampshire voters.</p><p>"For three weeks, of course I've had some problems in the polls," he said. "All I've been asked about by the press is a woman I didn't sleep with and a draft I didn't dodge." Trying to Broaden Question</p><p>Mr. Clinton also sought to broaden the question of character that has been raised by the accusations by noting that Dick Cheney, the Secretary of Defense had not served in the military and assailing President Bush for advocating a cut in the capital gains tax.</p><p>"If we're going to talk about 22 years ago, let's talk about my whole record as Governor, my demonsrations of character, my fitness to lead and compare to that kind of issue I think is very important too," he said.</p><p>The Clinton campaign also unveiled a new television commercial in New Hampshire tonight in which they seek to undermine the credibility of all the accusations against him by saying that the cabaret singer, Gennifer Flowers, was paid for her story and by blaming Republicans for the series of damaging disclosures.</p><p>At New Hampshire appearances earlier in the day in Claremont and Dover and on the ABC appearance last night, Mr. Clinton vowed to "fight like hell" to continue his campaign.</p><p>But the renewal of the questions about how Mr. Clinton handled his draft status added to the confused state of the contest in the nation's first Presidential primary.</p><p>"Jeez, another one," said Mr. Harkin, a former Navy pilot, in reference to the latest controversy. "I think voters should be concerned about his veracity and character. Listen, if someone wanted to serve in the military at that time, they could have served."</p><p>"Oh, God, please, not another one," said Senator Bob Kerrey, who lost part of a leg and won the Medal of Honor in combat in Vietnam. He has previously questioned the honesty of Mr. Clinton's dealings with the draft, but said he had no direct comment today.</p><p>But Mr. Clinton said today: "We've heard a lot in this campaign about the character issue. Well, character is an important issue, and so is patriotism. But this is not about my patriotism. I supported the Persian Gulf war because I thought it was right and in our national interest, just as I opposed the Vietnam War because I thought it was wrong and not in our national interest. And I still think I was right. The real character issue and the real patriotism issue in this election is who has a vision for the country, a plan for the future, and the ability to get it done."</p><p>Mr. Clinton also said today he letter had come to his attention again when his campaign director got a call from Ted Koppel, the host of "Nightline." "Ted Koppel told my campaign manager, David Wilhelm, the letter came from the Pentagon," said Mr. Clinton. Mr. Clinton said he obtained the text of the letter from ABC News.</p><p>The Pentagon denied a role in the disclosure. "It clearly was not the Pentagon that provided the letter in question," said Maj. Stephen Little of the Marine Corps, a Defense Department spokesman.</p><p>Mr. Koppel also said the source had contacted his program today to deny being connected with the Pentagon. The evening news program reported the letter tonight and said one of the program's sources was Col. Clinton Jones, a former Arkansas R.O.T.C. officer.</p><p>In response to the accusations from the Clinton campaign that there was a political motivation to the disclosure, Victoria Clarke, press secretary to the Bush campaign, said, "Every time they have a problem, they start whining, they start crying, they start blaming us."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
