But it seems probable that the Presidency will lose some of the clout it has won at the expense of Capitol Hill over the last four decades, that domestic affairs will resume their normal place at the center of American politics and that the Republican Party will have difficulty sustaining its recent surge.</p><p>All that and more probably lies ahead, even though for all but the oldest Americans it is hard to imagine American politics without the cold war. Leftist Views Eclipsed</p><p>"It was the defining issue in our political discourse and public policy from 1947 until last year," said Richard Holbrooke, a former Assistant Secretary of State.

William Fulbright used it to sell his scholarships and J. Edgar Hoover used it to sell his wiretaps."</p><p>As the nation turned virulently anti-Communist, socialism in all its forms was shunned like the plague. Programs such as national health care and broader trade-union rights nearly vanished from the screen of American politics. With rare exceptions, almost every successful national politician stood in the center or the right.</p><p>Every President from Harry Truman to George Bush -- Democrats like Lyndon B. Johnson and Jimmy Carter as well as Republicans like Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan -- sought to toe the hard line. The hard anti-Communist stance became as institutionalized at the White House as "Hail to the Chief" and the officer carrying the briefcase holding the nuclear-weapons codes.</p><p>But now all that has changed, and there could be no better evidence than the opening weeks of the 1992 Presidential campaign. Except for President Bush, none of the candidates have any significant foreign-policy credentials, and the rest of them are attacking the President for his. A governor, a former governor, two senators, a former senator and a newspaper columnist constitute the field of challengers. For the first time in decades, knowledge of the rest of the world seems to count for very little. In some ways provincialism may even be an asset.</p><p>In other years, hopefuls like Michael S. Dukakis or Jimmy Carter who had spent their careers on domestic questions surrounded themselves with prominent foreign-policy advisers and called foreign-policy conferences to show they cared. But this time, no one is even bothering. Indeed, the President's challengers are trying, with varying degrees of emphasis, to turn Mr. Bush's lifelong fascination with foreign affairs into a liability, a sign of his indifference to America's everyday concerns.</p><p>Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution, an experienced analyst of campaigns, sees Mr. Bush, a man whose attitudes were formed in the cold war years, as "the only candidate who is really trying to hold back the tide from the left and the right that is turning the country rapidly inward." The Policies Jobs, Jobs, Jobs? That's Right</p><p>The emphasis on domestic affairs developed even as the world went through its most convulsive changes since the 1950's. And it developed within a year of the allied triumph in the Persian Gulf -- a reminder, it might have been thought, that a President's foreign-policy skills can be useful, even in the post-postwar era.</p><p>Less than a year ago, America's resounding military victory in Kuwait and Iraq sent President Bush's national approval ratings to record highs and led many politicians to conclude that he would be unbeatable this year. Now all that seems irrelevant, and the President, in his State of the Union address last week and in his campaign commercials, is struggling to demonstrate that foreign affairs are not his only interest.</p><p>Senator Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat, echoed a significant segment of national opinion with a remark he made at the very beginning of his Presidential campaign last September.</p><p>"If you want to continue to spend $160 billion of your money to defend Europe from the Soviet Union, or whatever it's called now, take your ballot and put it in the Bush box," he said. "But if you believe that Europe is strong enough and rich enough and powerful enough to defend itself if it wants, then take your ballot and put it in the Democrats' box." How It Was in '88</p><p>Four years ago, neither Mr. Harkin nor any other major Democrat would have said that kind of thing. Mr. Dukakis rode around in a tank with a helmet on to show he wasn't soft. With the Soviet threat still intact, or thought to be, solidarity with the European allies was considered absolutely central. Almost every President made a pilgrimage to the Berlin wall.</p><p>This year, several Democrats have put out detailed foreign policy position papers, and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the early leader, made a point of warning against "retreating from the world or discounting its dangers."</p><p>But the only foreign policy topic on which the Democratic candidates have spent much time so far has been trade, especially trade with Japan. Some bash Japan and some don't. But all, like Mr. Bush, have tried to turn that global issue into a domestic challenge. If the President's trip to Japan was about "jobs, jobs, jobs" in the United States, the Democrats talk about the same thing in hard-hit New Hampshire.</p><p>Little is said about China or Croatia or Cuba. And Patrick J. Buchanan, Mr. Bush's main Republican rival, unashamedly reaches back to the 1930's for the key phrase of his insurgent nationalist campaign -- "America First," with its isolationist overtones.</p><p>All through the Nixon, Ford, Reagan and Bush years, the glue that bonded Republican to Republican was opposition to Communism and to higher taxes. Now one is moot and the other, at least in Mr. Buchanan's view, has been discarded by the President in his decision to increase taxes last year. Republican Struggle Resumes</p><p>No one expects Mr. Buchanan to defeat Mr. Bush. But his candidacy is evidence that the old, divisive struggle between the two wings of the Republican Party is resuming. In 1952, that struggle pitted the isolationists against the internationalists, the Taft forces against the Eisenhower forces. At the tumultuous San Francisco convention in 1964, it was the Goldwater wing versus the Rockefeller wing. But in the 24 years that followed,it has been the Republicans' ability to remain unified, in part around cold war themes, that has been a major element in the party's success.</p><p>Paul Weyrich, a prominent conservative organizer, remarked that now "there's at least a real danger that in 1992 conservative Republicans may go their own way, and if that's the case the Republicans may be in real trouble."</p><p>George Christian, a Texas political consultant who worked in the Johnson White House, asserted that the Republicans would be in deep difficulty already if the Democrats were in a stronger position. If Congress, long controlled by the Democrats, "didn't have such an awful reputation, and if the Democrats had some heavy hitters running for President, all the people ready to vote against Bush would have someplace to go, which they don't have now." The Presidency For Want of a Foe, Focus Is Lost</p><p>The public is apparently not eager to turn back to the isolationism of the 1920's and 30's. A New York Times/CBS News poll last October showed that while many Americans thought Mr. Bush should pay more attention to the economy, most were by no means ready to revert to the classic American isolationism of Hiram Johnson and William Borah.</p><p>About two-thirds of those surveyed agreed that the United States needed a strong military, despite the end of the cold war, and that it should keep playing as active a role in the world as ever.</p><p>In any event, American disengagement from the world in an era of instantaneous communication and international markets and investments is widely considered impractical. In the heyday of isolationism, few Americans bought many foreign products and even fewer traveled abroad.</p><p>Isolationism isn't really possible in the modern world, and some Americans are leaning that way now only because of the recession, in the view of John Bibby, a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin.</p><p>"My own notion is that the slow pace of the economic recovery has exacerbated domestic problems and concerns in the public's mind," he said. "But if and when the economy rights itself, this will change."</p><p>Still, the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, who in recent years has developed a cyclical theory of American politics, sees the 1990's, like the 1930's and the 1960's, as an era of domestic-policy prominence. In a sense, he said, "the cold war distorted our politics, and foreign policy became the obsessive concern of our Presidents, and that is going to return to normal now."</p><p>If he is correct, argues Representative Jim Leach, a Republican from Iowa, Congress is likely to be strengthened in its endless tug-of-war with the White House for policy dominance.</p><p>"We all understand," he said, "that Presidents are more dominant in moments of crisis, when we feel threatened as a nation. In matters of domestic policy, where there is less urgency, Congress has the upper hand -- which raises real questions about whether our legislatures in Washington and the state capitals are capable of providing the leadership we need."</p><p>But William E. Leuchtenberg, a historian at the University of North Carolina, contends that while the rivalry with Moscow may be a thing of the past, other foreign-policy crises will arise and strengthen the President, even if only temporarily.</p><p>"Look at the mass fervor generated by the Persian Gulf war," he said. "The decision to fight Saddam Hussein was essentially made in the White House, with major Congressional figures like Sam Nunn left dangling."</p><p>A principal Presidential asset in foreign policy, unmatched in domestic policy, is the ability to act at once and answer questions later. An armed response to the supposed provocation in the Gulf of Tonkin in 1964 contrasts sharply with the need to build a national consensus on, say, education policy before an attack can be launched. In the Name of Security</p><p>In moments of conflict with Congress, Presidents have also been able to appeal successfully to what one former White House chief of staff called "the great god national security." He added, "You tell 'em that they're helping no one but Brezhnev by their stubbornness, and they cave fast."</p><p>That has led America into a number of adventures over the last 45 years.</p><p>Concerns about the spread of Communism were the explanations for the Korean War, the C.I.A-directed coup in Guatemala, the military occuption of the Dominican Republic and the invasion of Grenada, among other episodes. Cold war competition using proxies in Israel and the Arab world fed the Middle East conflict for 40 years and provided the means for three wars.</p><p>And, of course, cold war concern about the "domino theory" and American credibility as a deterrent to Communist expansion led to the Vietnam War and the devastating social and political turmoil at home that came with its loss.</p><p>But the national security card is no longer available. Nor are some of the symbols of Presidential power, like that bag with the nuclear-weapons codes, quite so persuasive now that the specter of nuclear annihilation is receding.</p><p>"It is built into our system that a President doesn't get his way very easily on domestic policy unless there is an emergency like the Depression," said Steven A. Ambrose, biographer of Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard M. Nixon. "So you're bound to see some diminution in the Presidency in the years ahead. It's hard to lead a country without a recognized enemy, because there is no agreed focus."</p><p>The cold war provided that focus and that mission. The Parties With the New Order, New Challenges</p><p>Generally speaking, since Harry S. Truman's Administration the Republicans have been regarded as the ones better able to handle foreign policy problems -- even though it was the Truman Administration, with George C. Marshall and Dean Acheson playing central roles, that developed the main themes of American cold war policy. The Persian Gulf victory and arms control success seem to have reinforced the Republicans' image as the party most likely "to keep us out of World War III," to use Gallup's phrase.</p><p>At the same time, many voters saw the Democrats as the party of choice on economic issues, largely because of Franklin D. Roosevelt. During and after the Reagan years, when the New Deal was a fading memory, the advantage here shifted to the Republicans, though recent polls suggest it is shifting back. This is forcing Mr. Bush to spend more time on the economy and creating a crucial partisan battleground.</p><p>But Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the leader of the Democratic majority in the House, says the political fallout from the Soviet Union's disappearance from the world equation is actually far more complex.</p><p>"It has the potential to change the partisan balance, probably in our favor, because one of the themes they raised, especially in Presidential campaigns and often with considerable success, is that they were better able to deal with the Kremlin," he said. "But what we face now is a world with economics and foreign policy intertwined, where our embassies will have to deal with economics more than geopolitical questions, and where politicians will have to help in organizing here for economic success worldwide. That's a profound change, a challenge to anyone in public life."</p><p>Former Senator Howard H. Baker of Tennessee, a Republican who is also a former White House chief of staff, said, "There's an opportunity in all this bedlam as we move out of the warm glow of stability and walk the edge of anarchy, with dozens of small problems instead of one big confrontation."</p><p>"I see a major opportunity for some party to seize the advantage with clearly understood, well-stated policies," he said. "But I'm not seeing it yet, in the Congress or the White House, from the Republicans or the Democrats. Nobody's talking fundamentals; nobody's laying out goals."</p><p>NEXT: The new priorities of American foreign policy.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
