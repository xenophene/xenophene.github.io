Buchanan. "Don't worry about trying to send some message," Mr. Bush said in an interview from the White House on WMUR-TV in Manchester tonight, reflecting the underlying concern of his campaign about this recession-racked state.</p><p>On the Democratic side, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, who is leading in the polls here, tried to swell his support and follow a New Hampshire tradition: galvanizing an underdog's campaign in this first primary state. Dismissing the notion that his support comes largely from his status as a regional favorite, Mr. Tsongas told a rally in Concord, "Feel it, enjoy it, savor it -- and let's go get 'em." Storming the State</p><p>All five of the major Democratic candidates stormed New Hampshire today, hoping to elbow their way far enough up the rankings on Tuesday to give them some credibility in the scramble of primaries and caucuses that follow.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-first-para--></div><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ln-ctr-top" style="" class="mod-nytimesline mod-line"><!-- Module starts: ln-ctr-top (Line) --><center><div style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc; height:1px; width:350px;"></div></center><!-- Module ends: ln-ctr-top--></div><!-- Area starts: main-center-center --><div id="area-main-center-center" style=""><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ctr-lt-in-top" style="float:left;" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-lt-in-top (AdCpc) -->

Bill Clinton of Arkansas, with New Hampshire giving the first verdict from the voters on the extent of the damage to his candidacy after three weeks largely dominated by reports about his Vietnam-era draft status and the accusations, published in a supermarket tabloid, that he had a 12-year extramarital affair.</p><p>"I think we have survived remarkably, and I think the energy in this campaign is plainly with us," Mr. Clinton said today, when he made a ritualistic stop at Nashua City Hall, where John F. Kennedy stopped in his 1960 campaign. The Clinton campaign, however, was trying to play down expectations for Tuesday, with Mr. Clinton asserting that there was a "world of primaries to go." He clearly hopes to mend his campaign when the race moves to the flurry of primaries, March 3 and March 10, in his native South.</p><p>Most of the final New Hampshire polls showed Mr. Tsongas in the lead, followed by Mr. Clinton, with Senators Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Tom Harkin of Iowa neck and neck for third place, and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California lagging at the back.</p><p>Among the wild cards here is the strength of the write-in campaign for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, who continued to send mixed signals today to volunteers in New Hampshire. He said he regarded every write-in vote as "an embrace and a kiss from a stranger" but predicted that he would not do well because voters might think he was being "cute."</p><p>He also said he regretted not being able to run, "particularly now because there is ambiguity."</p><p>On this final day in New Hampshire, the undecided voter was king, but a confused king. Peter O'Neill, a 49-year-old program manager for the Raytheon Corporation who talked with Mr. Clinton at a coffee shop in Hudson, said he was torn between Mr. Clinton, Mr. Brown and Mr. Kerrey. "I'm in a dilemma," he said, as his breakfast omelette grew cold.</p><p>What the voters of New Hampshire have already done, however, is remind Mr. Bush of the short tether of elective office. The President was back in Washington today after a weekend of campaigning here, but his wife was working the state on his behalf and Mr. Bush himself was wooing New Hampshire Republicans long-distance via drive-time radio shows, television commercials and interviews on the Manchester evening news.</p><p>"I've been under fire from newspapers and then watched the news this morning, and apparently every single one of them was attacking me all day, and so was the other guy," Mr. Bush told WFEA radio in Manchester, reflecting a final stretch when he was, indeed, under heavy fire from both parties, and from voters outraged at the depth of the recession here.</p><p>"I don't know how to sort it out, but I am content that people in the final analysis will say we're not looking for slogans," the President said. The stakes for Mr. Bush here could hardly be higher: New Hampshire Republicans will essentially decide whether he gets to turn his sights to the general election and the Democrats, or leaves here limping and embarrassed, forced to contend with Mr. Buchanan in states down the road. An Economic Anger</p><p>Mr. Buchanan kept hammering away at the President as a man who abandoned his promises. "It is George Bush himself that's taxing and spending your future away," one of the Buchanan commercials asserted on this final day.</p><p>Mr. Buchanan himself spent his 44th day of campaigning in New Hampshire with a 231-mile bus tour that took him to 12 cities, where he thanked his supporters for showing the "courage" to stand up to a President in their own party. With many final polls showing him with the backing of just under 30 percent of New Hampshire Republicans, Mr. Buchanan refused to predict how well he would do, but said he would remain in the race until the Republican convention in Houston in August. As his bus sped between Exeter and Portsmouth, Mr. Buchanan described his campaign as a fight for "the heart and soul of the Republican Party."</p><p>In the view of many analysts, however, the real power of Mr. Buchanan's candidacy here comes from economic anger; the Bush campaign felt compelled to run television advertising, in these final days, urging voters to "send Congress a message" to "pass my plan for economic growth."</p><p>For the Democrats, Tuesday will be the first sorting-out of a field of five major contenders who entered the race late, stumbled often and left some in their party hungry for other candidates to join the fray.</p><p>"One of the dramas out of New Hampshire for the Democrats is whether something happens in the results that entices another Democrat in, sooner rather than later," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic poll taker who is not committed to any of the candidates. "A good Clinton second-place finish may slow down the momentum for a new entry, or at least make it harder."</p><p>Mr. Garin reflects an attitude among many Democrats that Mr. Tsongas has yet to demonstrate that his campaign will travel well. They wonder how much of his appeal is due to his regional roots and 10 months of patient grass-roots politics here, and how much is due to his personal appeal and his message of stern economic truth-telling. Mr. Tsongas took on those critics today, asserting, "The pundits who wrote me off are going to have to explain why." He added, "I'm a regional candidate -- North, South, East and West." 'I'm Still Standing'</p><p>Echoing the themes he has sounded throughout this campaign, Mr. Tsongas said the Democratic Party would continue its "fierce embrace" of human, social and enviornmental values, but would also become a pro-business party. "Some Democrats will find this very hard to take," said Mr. Tsongas, who endorses a cut in the tax on capital gains to encourage investment, a position that many fellow Democrats reject. "So be it. Tomorrow it happens."</p><p>Mr. Clinton, for his part, told reporters today that after the three weeks he has endured, "I think the greatest success is I'm still standing." The Arkansas Governor, who at one point led in the polls in New Hampshire and seemed on a glide path to the nomination, but has been struggling to steady his candidacy in recent days, said, "When I had more dumped on me in less time in a very organized, calculated way than any other politician in living history, we didn't lose a single living soul that was here fighting for what I believed in."</p><p>Mr. Kerrey, for his part, seemed genuinely upbeat today after receiving good reviews in many quarters for his performance in Sunday night's debate. The Nebraska Senator spent his final day of campaigning with the elderly in Concord, college students in Durham, veterans in Nashua and points between. Often faulted for over-emphasizing the health care issue, he said today that voters were beginning to understand that "national health insurance is just a beginning."</p><p>"Unless we have the courage to do this," he said, the nation will not muster the political courage to resolve a host of other problems.</p><p>Mr. Harkin was also hitting his basic message today, arguing, "Putting America back to work -- creating jobs -- will be the No. 1 priority of the Harkin Administration." Like other candidates, he, too, said he was in the race for the long haul. "We have a national campaign ready to roll right after tomorrow."</p><p>And while the announced candidates scrambled around New Hampshire, the rumbles of Cuomo continued, this time from a news conference in Manhattan. Once again he cited New York's budget difficulties as keeping him on the sidelines. He also said that even if he did well in New Hampshire and resolved his budget problems, a Presidential campaign at this point "probably would be academic." What's Next?</p><p>"I honestly believe there is no intelligence, no logic, to giving any credibility, any real import to the write-in results in New Hampshire, which will be a tiny infinitesimal proportion of all the votes you have to get in this country. It shouldn't be relevant." He added that he believed that at least one of the current candidates would demonstrate that he was electable by April and would become the party's nominee.</p><p>After the voting on Tuesday, the contest for the Democratic nomination spreads out across the country. The Maine caucuses will be held on Sunday, and if Mr. Tsongas wins here, he will be well-positioned to ride to another victory in that neighboring state; he has been organizing there for months, state party officials say.</p><p>Then, next Tuesday, comes the South Dakota primary. The two Midwesterners in the race, Mr. Harkin and Mr. Kerrey, are looking for a boost there, but a state party official said that interest in Mr. Tsongas was picking up in recent days as he began his television advertising there.</p><p>The next defining battle after New Hampshire, however, is on March 3, when primaries or caucuses will be held in Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, Idaho, Utah and Washington. This is when Mr. Tsongas hopes to show he can win a major victory outside his region, and thus win the credibility and, more importantly, the money, to go the distance. Dennis Kanin, his campaign manager, said Mr. Tsongas would be particularly emphasizing Maryland, Colorado and Washington.</p><p>"I think we have to win Maryland," Mr. Kanin said. Mr. Tsongas's political imperatives are reflected in his schedule on the day after New Hampshire's voting: He will fly to Baltimore for a rally and then on to New York City for a series of major fund-raising events.</p><p>On March 3, Mr. Clinton will be counting on his strong political support in Georgia, which includes Gov. Zell Miller, to put him over the top there, and prepare the way for the round of Southern primaries and caucuses that follow on March 10, known as Super Tuesday.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
