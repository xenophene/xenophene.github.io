Three of the Democratic Presidential contenders -- Bob Kerrey, Paul E. Tsongas and Bill Clinton -- have taken specific and competing positions on the issue.</p><p>Mr. Kerrey, a Senator from Nebraska, favors a system similar to Canada's, with coverage for all citizens at Government expense.</p><p>Mr. Tsongas, a former Senator from Massachusetts, supports "managed competition," in which insurers, doctors and hospitals would compete for contracts with large groups of citizens.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-first-para--></div><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ln-ctr-top" style="" class="mod-nytimesline mod-line"><!-- Module starts: ln-ctr-top (Line) --><center><div style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc; height:1px; width:350px;"></div></center><!-- Module ends: ln-ctr-top--></div><!-- Area starts: main-center-center --><div id="area-main-center-center" style=""><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ctr-lt-in-top" style="float:left;" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-lt-in-top (AdCpc) -->

Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, have been less specific. But they say they support some form of national health insurance. Mr. Harkin promises to call labor, business and Government leaders together and "preside at the head of the table" until they develop a comprehensive plan.</p><p>Some Republicans in Congress are also backing more ambitious plans than Mr. Bush. One measure sponsored by more than 20 Republican senators would help more people with tax credits and deductions than the Bush proposal would. The Republican plan would also give the Federal Government more authority to pre-empt state laws and regulations.</p><p>Political leaders agree that no comprehensive plan will be enacted this year. The Democrats in Congress will block Republican proposals, and the President would veto any Democratic plan that cleared Congress.</p><p>The only measure that stands a chance of passing is an incremental one sponsored by Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, the Democratic chairmen of the tax-writing committees. It would make medical insurance more available and affordable to small businesses and make it easier for workers to change jobs without fear of losing insurance coverage.</p><p>But even if nothing is resolved this year, the election-year debate seems likely to pave the way for fundamental changes in the health-care system in the next Administration, regardless of who is elected President. Strong Public Dissatisfaction</p><p>The reason for the politicians' interest is clear: polls show enormous public unhappiness with the current medical-care system, in which 35 million Americans have no insurance and costs are rising yearly at more than double the overall inflation rate.</p><p>For instance, The New York Times/ CBS News Poll published last week found that three-quarters of all adults would like to see the Government spend more to provide affordable health care for all Americans.</p><p>There are several reasons why so many people now do not have medical insurance. In some cases their employers do not provide it, and they cannot afford coverage on their own.</p><p>In addition, more than half the people in the country with incomes below the official poverty line are not covered by Medicaid, the Federal-state program for the poor. That is because in most cases only families on welfare are eligible. In many states, the welfare cutoff is well below the poverty line, $10,857 for a family of three last year, and as a general rule the basic welfare program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children, covers only families with children.</p><p>In capsule, here are the main plans that are under discussion: BUSH</p><p>Main elements: Vouchers for poor people and tax deductions for the middle class to help pay for medical insurance from private companies. The insurance companies would be required to provide coverage to anyone willing to pay for it, regardless of pre-existing medical conditions. Small businesses would be encouraged to band together to buy health insurance for their employees, lowering the cost by spreading the risk. Health maintenance organizations and other arrangements less costly than fee-for-service medicine would be encouraged. Medicare and Medicaid funds would be cut to raise money to finance the plan.</p><p>Advantages: Those who cannot now afford insurance would get basic coverage. This plan would be less disruptive to doctors, hospitals and insurers than other proposals. Government would not intrude in the marketplace. Taxes would not be raised.</p><p>Disadvantages: Mr. Bush did not specify how the added cost, about $35 billion a year, would be met. With little incentive for employers to shop for insurance plans, it might not be easy to keep costs down. Insufficient provisions are made for adjusting the vouchers and deductions to account for inflation or for dealing with regional health-cost differences. KERREY</p><p>Main elements: Similar to Canada's system, the Government would impose new taxes to raise money that would be passed on to the states. Medicare, Medicaid and employer-based insurance would be scrapped. People could choose a state insurance policy or a private policy meeting minimum Federal standards. The private companies would be paid a fixed amount by the states for each person enrolled. States would set medical-service fees.</p><p>Advantages: Everyone would get full coverage without paying premiums. Costs could be regulated because state systems would operate under fixed budgets. States and private insurers would compete over which could provide better benefits, perhaps leading to savings. Workers would not have to depend on employers for insurance.</p><p>Disadvantages: Higher taxes would be needed, though they would be offset somewhat by the better wages employers, freed of insurance costs, would be able to pay. A Federal bureaucracy would replace the free-market system. Services might have to be rationed if state budgets fell short. Without the incentive of earning more money, health providers might not invest in improved technology. TSONGAS</p><p>Main elements: Insurance would be bought for everyone by a group like a large company, several small companies banded together, a labor union or a public plan financed by payroll taxes on employers. The unemployed and workers without steady jobs would be placed in the public plan. Private insurance companies and health maintenance organizations would bid for contracts from these groups.</p><p>Advantages: The groups would wield considerable market power. Costs would be restrained because insurers would compete to provide attractive services and because favorable fees could be negotiated with doctors. Experts would monitor quality of care.</p><p>Disadvantages: To hold down costs, most companies would contract with health maintenance organizations rather than allow fee-for-service medicine. That would limit consumers' choice of doctors. People who are bad risks because of their medical conditions could probably be forced into the public plans, costing the Government money. The system might not adequately control the rapidly rising cost of medical care. CLINTON</p><p>Main elements: Employers would have to insure all employees or pay an additional tax into a public fund to cover the uninsured. One such plan approved last month by the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee would put the tax at 7.5 percent of payroll. A Government board would set national medical-care cost goals and perhaps actual prices.</p><p>Advantages: This would be less disruptive of the current system than the Kerrey or Tsongas approaches, would require little additional Federal financing and would keep insurance companies happy, which could make it acceptable politically. A big tax increase on workers would be avoided.</p><p>Disadvantages: If the payroll tax is set too low and costly conditions are placed on insurance plans, employers would opt to dump workers into the public plan. If the tax is set high, it would be an invisible tax on wages. Price controls could discourage doctors and hospitals from improving quality.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
