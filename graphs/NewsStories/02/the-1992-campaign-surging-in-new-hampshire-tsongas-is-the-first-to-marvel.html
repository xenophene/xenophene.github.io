It began in a germ-free room at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, where Mr. Tsongas spent six weeks in isolation recovering from radical lymphoma therapy and deciding that he wanted to do something special with whatever time he had left. He still counts the number of days since he first felt a lump in his groin on Sept. 29, 1983: 3,058.</p><p>He did not think of running for President himself at first. He suggested to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York that he run and talked to Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. But in the end, with the sound of one hand clapping, Mr. Tsongas decided to take his beloved 86-page pamphlet, "A Call to Economic Arms," covering everything from a recycling ethic to spirituality, and run himself.</p><p>Mr. Tsongas says he believes that despite the fact that the nation andparty took years to recover from the Jimmy Carter malaise message, the voters are ready for someone unvarnished who will tell them to take their economic medicine without the sugar-coating of middle class tax cuts.</p><p>"The country knows that there's been a lot of glitz and morning-in- America years and the net result of not facing up to reality is what they're looking at now," he said. "And there comes a point in everyone's life when they get scared and say: 'Enough. Hey, we're grownups. Tell us the truth. We can handle it.' "</p><p>Last night, at a crowded 51st birthday party for Mr. Tsongas at a Holiday Inn here, his doctor, Tak Takvorian, was citing an invitation for the candidate to be the host of "Saturday Night Live" as an indication that he's ready for prime time.</p><p>But when Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas stumbled a second time and the spotlight swung to Mr. Tsongas this week in New Hampshire, he was nowhere to be found. To the utter astonishment of the pundits, his public schedule was nearly empty on Tuesday and empty on Wednesday.</p><p>Riding in his campaign van on Thursday, Mr. Tsongas was asked how he spent his day off. Without looking up from his favorite task, signing copies of his economic booklet, he replied: "I took my daughter to school. I went swimming. I spent three hours on the phone. In the evening, I spent some quiet time with the kids. I heard all the horror stories about overscheduling on the Dukakis campaign and I don't want to run around like a chicken without a head, exhausting myself and making no progress and looking haggard on television."</p><p>Mr. Tsongas, whose doctor says he has been free of cancer for five years, knows questions are raised about his health when he keeps light schedules. But he has his own way of dealing with the health issue, and it is, as usual, straightforward.</p><p>He has entered the national Masters and Y.M.C.A. swimming competitions with the strenuous butterfly stroke, not a stroke he usually swims, as "a political statement." Reporters at the Y</p><p>On Thursday at the Concord Y.M.C.A., Mr. Tsongas allowed the cameras and reporters to come with him while he went swimming.</p><p>An embarrassed Mr. Tsongas took off his sweat suit, stripped down to his bikini Speedo, and did a few laps while boom microphones hung over his head and reporters tried to ask questions without falling in the pool.</p><p>What if Roger Ailes, the conservative political consultant, and the Republicans spread rumors about his health? he was asked.</p><p>"I've issued a challenge to Roger Ailes: 50 yards of the butterfly, kiddo," Mr. Tsongas said, as he stood at the end of the pool.</p><p>When one reporter suggested that such a challenge might finish off the Falstaffian Mr. Ailes, Mr. Tsongas shrugged, saying, "If it happens, it happens."</p><p>Mr. Tsongas gets tired of being asked about his recurrent cough, and tells reporters that it is simply from a dry throat, and that Mr. Clinton has the same thing. But Dr. Takvorian says the explanation is that because of the candidate's "history of radiation," his throat tends to get drier.</p><p>While Mr. Tsongas says he knows he has to change if he wants to run the sort of campaign that could survive in the South and West and challenge President Bush, he still seems too caught up in the wonder of his sudden surge to do more than enjoy it.</p><p>"I intend to make lack of charisma the chic phenomenon of 1992," he said. Marketing Plainness</p><p>His earnest discussion of issues and his dry, self-deprecating humor delivered with Bob Newhart timing have worked well for him in small group meetings with well-informed, flinty New Hampshire voters.</p><p>But now Mr. Tsongas is struggling with the notion of how to market plainness as a national identity.</p><p>He seems to believe on some instinctive level that even though the Democrats are dubious about whether nebbish power will carry him to the convention, he must stay a minimalist.</p><p>"If I begin to be a man of many notes, then I get lost in that," he said.</p><p>His only bows to political sophistication so far: He has acquired a dozen red striped ties, a totem he respects so much that when he sees others wearing red striped ties he accuses them of wanting to be his vice president. For debates, he has learned how to sit up alertly at the table with hands folded and look directly at the moderator.</p><p>He has also learned to smile more, even though he feels like "a smiling baboon" sometimes. "Even Mario Cuomo told me to smile more," he said. Sense of Amazement</p><p>No one is more amazed at his new status than Mr. Tsongas himself, who, like the proverbial tortoise passing the hare, looks around him with a slow, blinking bemusement at the vagaries of fate.</p><p>He laughs at a newspaper column declaring of his candidacy, "I've seen the future and it isn't pretty," and he says: "You know what my reaction to this is? Wonder. If I had not lived through this, I would not have believed these things are possible."</p><p>Although the crowds and cameras have arrived, the short, pale, balding candidate is so low key that he often sidles into the midst of voters and handlers before they even know he has arrived. The stealth campaigner stands quietly, waiting for the attention to come to him, a stark contrast to politicians like Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Clinton, who force themselves upon a room.</p><p>The late-night comedians are already having a field day. Johnny Carson joked that Mr. Tsongas's slogan should be "Paul Tsongas: The Only Candidate Who Can't Get Babes."</p><p>But unlike Michael S. Dukakis, who left Democrats and Greek-Americans traumatized with his robotic delivery and failure to fight back against George Bush, Mr. Tsongas has an engaging wit. He knows that humor may leaven his preachiness and his dour economic message.</p><p>At his birthday party, his campaign played a song by the Capital Steps comedy group, "The Sounds of Tsongas," sung to the tune of "The Sounds of Silence," that suggested the candidate was boring, the voters were snoring and "the words you can profit from are written by a dweebish nerd." An Egotistical Streak</p><p>Of course, with his rising status come tougher questions, and Mr. Tsongas sometimes gets tetchy when asked about his former lobbying activities and his support of nuclear power, an unpopular position among Democrats in this state.</p><p>Those who have followed his career have noticed an egotistical streak, a moral certainty, buried within the self-deprecation, and that could turn out to be a political weakness.</p><p>At a fund-raising event one night, he told his listeners that before his surge in the polls, he sometimes wondered why he was running and felt this way toward the American public, "If they want to go to hell, let 'em go."</p><p>And at Dartmouth College last week, he snapped at a young man who talked about the dangers of radiation, referring to a nuclear plant run by a utility company that includes Mr. Tsongas as a board member.</p><p>"Don't ever lecture me about cancer," he told the student in an atypical meltdown. "When you've had it and dealt with it, then we can have a discussion."</p><p>It was the sort of thin-skinned reaction to criticism that has been rare in a campaign where Mr. Tsongas has been largely ignored. But those who have watched him over years say this sanctimonious streak is likely to surface more as he comes under more intense scrutiny.</p><p>Recalling the Dartmouth incident in an interview the other day, Mr. Tsongas said softly: "The cancer thing is very close to the surface. The one thing this campaign has done is bring a lot of old memories and emotions very close to the surface that, in normal life, are pretty far down in my psyche."</p><p>About his Democratic rivals who have promised tax cuts and easier economic nostrums, he said: "To hell with them. They all took the easy cop-out. So to hell with them."</p><p>Mr. Tsongas's no-Santa-Claus prescription for the country reflects his own fate. It is a realism shaped as much by illness as by political experience.</p><p>So as he leaves these taciturn parts for states that like a little show business with their politics, he observes, "Whatever happens, happens," and he adds, "This is when the brutal part starts."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
