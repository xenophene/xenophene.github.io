Nixon offers some predictions.</p><p>The former President, passing through town to talk some politics, forecast the 1992 election this way:</p><p>If Bill Clinton wins New Hampshire, he will roll into the nomination, unless there are new revelations. But Mr. Nixon suggested that the Clinton campaign would have to be careful about how it uses Hillary Clinton, because in general, "If the wife comes through as being too strong and too intelligent, it makes the husband look like a wimp."</p><p>Mr. Nixon praised Barbara Bush as a model of a wife who has her own opinions without upstaging her husband, and suggested that many Americans are still put off by a male politician who does not seem to be as strong as his wife. The former President allowed that, unfortunately, some voters agree with Cardinal de Richelieu, who said, "Intellect in a woman is unbecoming."</p><p>If Governor Clinton comes in second to Paul E. Tsongas, there will be agitation for a new candidate because, as Mr. Nixon noted drily, "Tsongas is too responsible to be nominated by the Democrats."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-first-para--></div><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ln-ctr-top" style="" class="mod-nytimesline mod-line"><!-- Module starts: ln-ctr-top (Line) --><center><div style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc; height:1px; width:350px;"></div></center><!-- Module ends: ln-ctr-top--></div><!-- Area starts: main-center-center --><div id="area-main-center-center" style=""><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ctr-lt-in-top" style="float:left;" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-lt-in-top (AdCpc) -->

Mario M. Cuomo, noting that his name is easily spelled.</p><p>He has privately told friends he would relish seeing a race between the President and the New York Governor, whom he describes as "a heavyweight."</p><p>He said his former speechwriter, Patrick J. Buchanan, would get 28 percent of the vote in New Hampshire.</p><p>Mr. Nixon suggested that the Democrats might win the Electoral College and still lose the popular vote, titillating political science professors. He said the President would win the general, although he could lose California, which would make him dependent on having a solid South, plus Ohio and Illinois, which he said would be the battlegrounds of the election.</p><p>He said that the Republicans would gain 25 seats in the House, and would stay even, or lose two seats, in the Senate.</p><p>For anyone who doubts the accuracy of Mr. Nixon's predictions, remember that in 1966, a crucial year in his political comeback, he predicted that the Republicans would gain 47 House seats. They did. Cuomo Treasure</p><p>For those still fascinated with the thinking of Governor Cuomo, here is a bit of buried treasure.</p><p>In 1987, The New York Times columnist William Safire sent Mr. Cuomo a copy of his "Political Dictionary," marking the segment on "Presidential Draft," which begins: "A demand by a party that a man not seeking the nomination accept it; upon rare occasion, applies to one who did not encourage his own candidacy."</p><p>The Governor sent back a note with the line, "Re 'draft,' see the last paragraph of your 'Brokered Convention.' "</p><p>That paragraph reads: "By 1972, the proliferation of primaries and erosion of the 'unit rule' made brokerage more difficult, though not impossible." Editing Bush</p><p>The most important member of President Bush's campaign team may not be pollster, speechwriter or spin doctor. It just may be the editor who cuts and snips the footage for his campaign commercials.</p><p>In his first commercial, President Bush is presented as caring and crisp.</p><p>"This state has gone through hell," he tells a group of insurance workers in Dover, N.H. "It's gone through an extraordinarily difficult time."</p><p>Mr. Bush's actual answer, cut off mid-sentence, was not quite so polished.</p><p>"This state has gone through hell," he said, according to the official transcript. "It's gone through an extraordinarily difficult time, coming off of a pinnacle, you might say, of low unemployment. Now, you're at about the national level. And yes, people are hurting. And I am determined to turn it around.</p><p>"I told some of them over there -- there's a big difference, you know. People say to me -- difference between domestic and foreign policy. How could you lead the world -- and they gave me some credit for that in Desert Storm, that the American people still feel very, very strongly about -- and -- how can you do that and then have such difficulties with this economy?" Clinton Humor</p><p>Mr. Clinton has been fighting off a cold and allergies for a week now. "I wonder if they'll vote for a dead man," he muttered today, as he wandered about New Hampshire tearing and wheezing.</p><p>But he has tried to keep a sense of humor throughout his trial by tabloid.</p><p>At Portland High School in Maine last weekend, Alyssa O'Brien asked the Arkansas Governor what he thought of a newspaper advertisement placed by a Maine Citizens' Group asserting that President Bush fails to pay state income taxes there. The President owns a home in Kennebunkport but claims a hotel suite in Houston as his principal residence.</p><p>"I guess when he said no new taxes, he meant himself," Ms. O'Brien said.</p><p>Mr. Clinton grinned and said that such behavior was "not right." Then, flashing a pointed glance at the assembled press corps, he added: "If I did that, they'd write it up in one of those tabloids." Man in Demand</p><p>John Doggett, the man who taught the Senate about ego and erotomania, has moved from defending Clarence Thomas to defending Bill Clinton.</p><p>"God, this is my year, right?" said Mr. Doggett, a business consultant from Austin who went to Yale Law School with Mr. Thomas and the Clintons. "I'm checking through my book to see what my other classmates might do."</p><p>As a witness on behalf of Mr. Thomas during the Senate hearings about Anita F. Hill's accusation of sexual harassment last fall, Mr. Doggett gave a performance so loquacious and boastful that Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. was moved to comment on his "enormous ego."</p><p>He said that Anita Hill had found him so attractive that she had developed a romantic fixation on him, a story meant to back up the Republican suggestion that Ms. Hill was an erotomaniac.</p><p>Now it's deja vu all over again, as Yogi Berra said, for Mr. Doggett. He said that, at the request of a Clinton aide, he showed up at a rally in Austin last week to act as a character witness for the Arkansas Governor, who had just been hit by tabloid mania.</p><p>"The irony is that Clarence and Bill were both at Yale Law School, and both of them had their chance at very important positions questioned by women who made accusations with sexual overtones and both of them came forward with very clear, straightforward, believable answers that were complete denials," said Mr. Doggett, who said he has been deluged with calls, letters and speaking offers because he had "the strength to tell those guys in the Senate where to get off."</p><p>Mr. Dogget said he was a Democrat until 1990 when he switched to the Republican Party. But he left a different impression with Mr. Clinton. Mr. Clinton said he was surprised when Mr. Doggett showed up at a rally in Austin last fall and said, "I'm a Democrat. My wife's a Democrat. We really want to be for you," and then appeared at last week's rally in Austin as well.</p><p>Mr. Doggett, however, tells it differently. "I absolutely support Bill as a Democrat. I feel very comfortable saying that. But if I had to vote today I would vote for President Bush because I registered as a Republican. I don't feel that's a contradiction even though my political friends say, 'You can't do that, John.' My bottom line is that I'm not a politician. I'm a human being and American citizen."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
