Ickes joined Gov. Bill Clinton's Presidential quest surprised many of Mr. Ickes's political colleagues. Not just because the Arkansan is viewed as a moderate and the iconoclastic Mr. Ickes is a liberal from the West Side of Manhattan who profoundly disagrees with Mr. Clinton's support of the death penalty.</p><p>Most people were surprised for another reason. Mr. Clinton is -- or was -- considered the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. And Mr. Ickes, who is as unconventional as he is committed, has been a perennial supporter of losers. Four years ago, he supported the Rev. Jesse Jackson, not to make a President, but to make a point about the Democratic Party's drift from its liberal roots.</p><p>Mr. Ickes's value to a campaign is as an unrelenting tactician. He can also deliver a devoted following. When City Councilwoman Ronnie M. Eldridge, a Democrat who represents the Upper West Side, was recently asked why she was supporting the Governor, an uncharacteristically moderate candidate by her standards, she responded with two words: "Harold Ickes."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-first-para--></div><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ln-ctr-top" style="" class="mod-nytimesline mod-line"><!-- Module starts: ln-ctr-top (Line) --><center><div style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc; height:1px; width:350px;"></div></center><!-- Module ends: ln-ctr-top--></div><!-- Area starts: main-center-center --><div id="area-main-center-center" style=""><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ctr-lt-in-top" style="float:left;" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-lt-in-top (AdCpc) -->

Ickes, who was Secretary of the Interior and who carried out tough tasks for Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, has been immersed in politics for 25 years. But about the closest he has come to a cabinet were those that he fashioned as a part-time carpenter. He has managed campaigns for candidates whose headquarters he sometimes built himself, whose philosophy he shared and whom he valiantly fought the good fight for and usually lost. Iconoclastic Tactician</p><p>Mr. Clinton's campaign, which Mr. Ickes directs in New York State, is the first in which he has enlisted with a candidate who is apparently the front-runner. Mr. Clinton represents a candidate with whom Mr. Ickes differs on several issues, but who he believes has the best chance of defeating President Bush.</p><p>Disputed allegations about sexual affairs, derogatory comments about Gov. Mario M. Cuomo that Mr. Clinton acknowledges having made and, more recently, questions about his draft status may undermine what is perhaps the greatest source of his support, the view that he is the most electable Democrat in the field.</p><p>"I think there's no question a lot of people are undoubtedly raising that as a serious question, and my sense is their judgment is being withheld until New Hampshire results are in," Mr. Ickes said.</p><p>He added that "any front-runner is bound to take some lumps," but he acknowledged that whether Mr. Clinton was the front-runner was debatable. "I don't know what tense to use any more," he said.</p><p>"I knew about the rumors, but I never knew they had any substance and still don't," said Mr. Ickes, whose father's affair during his first marriage was an open secret that went unreported.</p><p>Mr. Ickes has devoted much of his energies lately to damage control. He telephoned political and labor leaders who had signed up to be Clinton delegates or who had pledged their support, trying to gauge the degree to which they might be wavering and to reassure those who were that their candidate may have been wounded, but not fatally, if for no other reason, he reasoned, than there is no obvious alternative.</p><p>"I'm pleased that nobody has defected," Mr. Ickes said. He acknowledged, though, that "this is a big bump," as he tried to sound philosophical about a setback that might more deeply embitter politicians who were less accustomed to losing.</p><p>"First impressions affect people, and for people first learning about Bill Clinton, they may be concerned," he said. "I wouldn't want anyone to go into my background. None of us is perfect. None of what has come out has shaken me. None of it throws into question his character."</p><p>If Mr. Ickes needed more diversion from the campaign or the demands of his law practice, as counsel to Mayor David N. Dinkins's campaign committee he also helped investigations of the committee chairman, Arnold I. Biegen, who was indicted last week on Federal and state charges that he stole $158,000 in campaign money. From Lowenstein's First Race</p><p>Whatever Mr. Clinton's appeal, the breadth of his support in New York is widely credited to Mr. Ickes's persistence and to the loyalty of the following he has developed since he worked in Allard K. Lowenstein's first, and unsuccessful, Congressional campaign, which Ms. Eldridge managed. Mr. Ickes has never run for office and probably never could, because of the prickly personality that he inherited from his father, a self-proclaimed curmudgeon. But the younger Mr. Ickes has toiled tirelessly for others.</p><p>Even Mr. Clinton's rivals concede that he has received the bulk of organization support in the state, including the Democratic leaders of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island, the heads of the teachers' and New York City municipal employees' unions and the people whom Mr. Ickes described as "West Side liberals like myself." Many of those liberals and many more labor leaders might have been expected to support Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, Mr. Ickes said.</p><p>"But that assumes Bill is conservative or at best a moderate," Mr. Ickes said. "I consider him progressive in the best sense." 'A Phenomenal Campaigner'</p><p>Mr. Ickes said he also disagreed with Mr. Clinton's support for armed intervention against Iraq last year, but added: "I agree with him on many more things than I disagree with him on. He is a phenomenal campaigner. I just don't think the others measure up. I don't think they're electable."</p><p>Mr. Clinton, who met Mr. Ickes 20 years ago in the antiwar movement, telephoned him at his law office in Mineola, L.I., last summer to sound him out about running his campaign for the primary on April 7. Mr. Ickes hesitated, only in case Mr. Jackson decided to run again, but not out of concern that Mr. Cuomo might, because, Mr. Ickes said, Mr. Cuomo was not an announced candidate and had not reached out to him. Removal of Adding Machines</p><p>Everyone who has worked with him has a favorite Harold Ickes story. At one party meeting in a hotel upstate, he joined his political mentor and the man who was going to become his law partner, John F. English, then the Nassau County Democratic chairman, and Carol Opton, another politician, in a precautionary strike to thwart a rival candidate for Democratic national committeeman. They spirited away all the adding machines that would have been needed to compute the weighted vote the next day. The caper proved to be unnecessary, though. Working through the night, they mustered enough support for their own candidate, Basil A. Paterson.</p><p>At the 1976 national convention, Sarah Kovner, another liberal from the West Side, recalled, Mr. Ickes was instrumental in bringing the issue of amnesty for Vietnam draft resisters to the delegates' attention. He arranged to have a conscientious objector nominated for vice president and seconded by Ron Kovic, the wounded veteran depicted in the film "Born on the Fourth of July."</p><p>When convention officials insisted that they could not accommodate Mr. Kovic's wheelchair at the podium, Mr. Ickes exclaimed: "You did it for George Wallace. You can do it for him." They did. Young Farmer and Cowboy</p><p>Mr. Ickes is known for his political and legal acumen, the zeal and, often, the good humor with which he pursues every goal. Although his bark is usually bigger than his bite, at one argument he sunk his teeth into an adversary's leg. He once nearly hit a county leader. In 1965, a beating by three white men in Louisiana, where he was a civil rights advocate, cost him his left kidney.</p><p>Mr. Ickes, who lives in Manhattan with his wife, Laura Handman, also a lawyer, and their 5-year-old daughter, grew up on a farm in Maryland. He worked as a cowboy after graduating from high school; received a pilot's license in New Mexico; majored in economics at Stanford University, where he met Mr. Lowenstein, and graduated from the Columbia University Law School.</p><p>He worked in the Presidential efforts of Jimmy Carter, Eugene J. McCarthy, Mr. Jackson and Edward M. Kennedy and for other candidates, including Paul O'Dwyer, William Fitts Ryan and Robert F. Wagner Jr. What distinguished his latest foray was Mr. Clinton's early anointment by opinion polls and politicians as the candidate to beat.</p><p>"I've never chosen a Presidential candidate because they were necessarily going to win," Mr. Ickes said. "But it doesn't hurt."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
