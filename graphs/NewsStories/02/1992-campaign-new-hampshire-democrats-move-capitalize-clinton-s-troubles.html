He defended Mr. Clinton, attacked President Bush, and joked about his lack of charisma.</p><p>It was a day when New Hampshire was humming with politics, from the floor of the Statehouse to the environs of the Portsmouth Shipyard, from the overloaded airwaves of Manchester and Boston television to the the storefront campaign offices crowded with volunteers in downtown Concord. There was a keen pitch of excitement among the strategists and staffers who were struggling to get a handle on a race where so many voters seem so undecided so late.</p><p>New Hampshire voters are chronically, perhaps congentially, volatile, but Chris Spirou, the state Democratic chairman, said today, "I don't think we've ever faced this situation before." Clinton Does Some Explaining</p><p>Mr. Clinton sprinted back on the campaign trail today, one day after he found himself explaining and defending a letter he wrote in 1969 thanking an Army officer overseeing an Reserve Officers Training Corps program for "saving" him from the draft. His campaign advisers said he was intent on reaching over the heads of the news media and speaking directly to the voters; he did so tonight with a 30-minute live television show.</p><p>Mr. Clinton hired an independent research firm to assemble a dozen undecided voters who were allowed to quiz the Governor on any subject.</p><p>"For 13 years, this story was always the same in Arkansas. Until I got into the Presidential race, no one ever said anything different," he said. "And even nw, the facts are not in dispute. I put myslef into the draft and I got a high number."</p><p>He was also on the air with television commercials defending his draft record.</p><p>This afternoon, Mr. Clinton spoke, with palpable pleasure, of the themes that were the centerpiece of his campaign until it was rocked by accusations of infidelity from a supermarket tabloid, accusations that Mr. Clinton flatly denied. His voice grew stronger and his style ever more impassioned as he stood before the New Hampshire Legislature and talked of the economic challenges facing the nation. "We have to go beyond the established political solutions," he said. Alluding to Mr. Harkin, Mr. Clinton noted that he was sometimes accused of not being a "real Democrat."</p><p>The Arkansas Governor, who adroitly positioned himself last year as the voice of a redefined Democratic Party, added, "I do know I'm against brain-dead politics, in either party, or both." Throughout the day, the voters asked Mr. Clinton about Medicare, AIDS, the deficit and the future of the Haitian refugees; but the reporters who swarmed around him at every stop asked about the draft.</p><p>Still, he seemed energized by the crowds. "Every election is a fight, it's a contest," Mr. Clinton told cheering students at Winnisquam High School in Tilton, where, coincidentally, it was 60's Day and the students wore headbands, tie-dyed shirts and fringed vests. Bringing Along Charisma</p><p>Mr. Tsongas picked up an endorsement today from Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d of Massachusetts. After Mr. Kennedy delivered a rousing speech in Concord on his behalf, Mr. Tsongas quipped, "People say I don't have any charisma, so I brought some." When asked about Mr. Clinton's problems, Mr. Tsongas said he had no problem with the issues being raised, but objected to the frenzied manner in which they were being raised. He criticized Mr. Bush's health care plan as inadequate, and he defended himself from an attack from Mr. Harkin.</p><p>Emblematic of Mr. Tsongas's new stature in the race are the attacks now coming his way. Mr. Harkin, who is running neck and neck with Mr. Kerrey in the nightly tracking polls, used the Seabrook nuclear power plant as a backdrop to stress his emphasis on alternative energy sources and assailed Mr. Tsongas for favoring nuclear power.</p><p>"Mr. Tsongas has been a Seabrook cheerleader for that plant right there," Mr. Harkin declared. "There is no such thing as a pro-nuclear environmentalist." Mr. Harkin, who is running as the "real Democrat" in the race and the voice of traditional Democratic values, is also on the air with a new television commercial attacking Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Tsongas, asserting they are promoting "trickle-down" economics. And in an interview, Mr. Harkin asserted that "the myriad of problems that seem to confront Mr. Clinton all the time" had eliminated him as a serious contender in New Hampshire. Kerrey's Added Edge</p><p>"It looks as though this race is coming down to a two-person race: Mr. Tsongas and myself," Mr. Harkin asserted. "We're closing in. The surge is out there. I feel the undercurrents pushing us up."</p><p>Mr. Kerrey's camp, obviously, sees the race quite differently. The Nebraska Senator is trying to present himself as the logical alternative to a damaged Mr. Clinton and to Mr. Tsongas, who is seen by many Democrats as something of a favorite son in New Hampshire who may not travel well. From the start of his campaign, Mr. Kerrey's allies have tried to present him as a Democrat who would be exceedingly well positioned against Mr. Bush in the fall, arguing that his record as a Medal of Honor winner, who lost his leg in Vietnam, makes him immune to the accusation of being soft on defense.</p><p>This argument, however, took on an added edge over the past few days, as the furor over Mr. Clinton's draft status grew. The commercial now on the air for Mr. Kerrey not only touts his military record, but notes that he is "not a regional candidate," apparently a swipe at Mr. Tsongas.</p><p>"We just have to drive our points home," said Steve Jarding, Mr. Kerrey's press secretary. "In some ways, it's easy. In some ways, it's frightening, because you don't have a second chance."</p><p>Mr. Kerrey himself told reporters today: "Every day this campaign rushes up to the wire. It's clear to me, this is a wide open race."</p><p>The organizers of an effort to write-in Governor Mario M. Cuomo here announced they were holding a rally on Sunday, featuring Arthur Schlesinger Jr. In a statement today, Mr. Schlesinger declared, "Mario Cuomo is the strongest candidate the Democrats can come up with" to beat Mr. Bush.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
