Economic conditions vary considerably in the region. And the notion of the South as a political land apart, particularly within party primaries, died decades ago.</p><p>"I don't think the candidates are going to preach a gospel that's any different in the South than any place else," said James Cobb, a history professor at the University of Tennessee. "Southern politics have become more nationalized, and national politics have become Southernized."</p><p>Certainly, some economic concerns are national.</p><p>"The economy is very much the 800-pound gorilla everywhere," said Alan Secrest, a Democratic poll-taker and consultant, who often worked with candidates in the South. More Stable Economy</p><p>But no state in the South has an economy that has been whipsawed the way New Hampshire has been. Between December 1990 and December 1991, non-farm employment in New Hampshire fell by 3.2 percent, a percentage drop exceeded only by New York and Connecticut. In the Southern states where primaries are scheduled, Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi saw modest job gains; Georgia had the largest employment decline in the region, but at 1.8 percent that decline was half as severe as New Hampshire.</p><p>"New Hampshire went from first to worst, and that's why the economy was so important for them," said Donald Ratajczak, director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University. "The economy's not going to be forgotten, but it's not as extreme a picture here."</p><p>Dr. Ratajczak said the closest thing to New Hampshire's economic roller coaster can be found in Virginia, Georgia and Florida. "There you have the same thing to a smaller extent," he said. "You had states that were outperforming the national average and then we fell into a recession and performed at the same dismal average as the nation as whole."</p><p>In Atlanta, for example, a survey of local residents a year ago found that 65 percent were satisfied with economic conditions. The same survey recently found 29 percent were satisfied. Mixed Battleground</p><p>In the two main Super Tuesday battlegrounds, the picture is also mixed. In Florida, the unemployment rate jumped to 7.3 percent in December 1991 from 5.5 percent in December 1990, a percentage increase that exceeded New Hampshire in the same period. In Texas, unemployment was almost unchanged in the same period, increasing to 6.7 percent from 6.5 percent.</p><p>"Texas ranked first among the top 15 states in job growth during the recession," said Ray Perryman, an economic consultant and economist in residence at Baylor University. "I don't think the economy will be as dominant here was it was in New Hampshire."</p><p>Still, he said economics could still play a role in a somewhat different way. On the Democratic side, a familiarity with energy issues is considered important, a factor that could work for Gov. Bill Clinton from the neighboring energy-producing state of Arkansas.</p><p>On the Republican side, few doubt that President Bush's longtime ties to Texas and his ability to direct Federal resources toward the state will be a major economic consideration in the race. Some Deep Concerns</p><p>For many Southerners, particularly those most directly affected, the economic concerns may be as deep as they were in New Hampshire.</p><p>"I'm looking at the candidates to see their stance on health care and the economy," said Karen Fort, a caterer in New Orleans, who is struggling to keep alive the catering business she started after losing her job in the computer industry.</p><p>But, for most Southerners, the region's historic poverty takes the edge off the current downturn.</p><p>"We don't seem as mad, maybe because our fall has not been as far as other parts of the country," said Allie Mack, a political science professor at Jackson State University in Mississippi. "Things were pretty bad here before the latest downturn in the economy. We here in the South have a long history of adjusting fairly well to bad times with few complaints and groans."</p><p>Thus, the economy may be the gorilla, but it may not be the voting issue, some analysts say. Instead, if there is one thing that does define politics in the South it is that personal and cultural factors often outweigh anything else.</p><p>"Our voters respond to personality, to emotional appeals," said Natalie Davis, a political science professor at Birmingham Southern College in Alabama. "We don't like to get too detailed. Image is more important than substance. We vote for people we like." Raising Cultural Topics</p><p>But the effects of cultural and personality issues can be a lot more difficult to calculate than economic ones.</p><p>For instance, Patrick J. Buchanan has shifted the focus of his challenge to President Bush in the South, moving from the economic message he hammered at in New Hampshire to one freighted with cultural issues, like advertisements that accuse Mr. Bush of supporting investing tax dollars in "pornographic and blasphemous art."</p><p>But it is not enough to raise the right issues in the South. You have to raise them in the right way. And many here question whether Mr. Buchanan's bare-knuckles approach will appeal to Southern Republicans.</p><p>"I read something the other day that Northerners enjoy arguing as a kind of sport," said Professor Cobb of the University of Tennessee. "For Southerners, it's a prelude to shooting each other. His personality may be too pugnacious; he doesn't have many of the kind of personal qualities I think Southern white voters would be inclined to appreciate."</p><p>On the Democratic side, that same instinct obviously works for Governor Clinton, who never fails to mention in the South that it is nice to be back in a region where he is the only one who does not speak with an accent. But Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska is already trying to make Mr. Clinton's draft history an issue in a way he did not in New Hampshire. And throughout the South, in a way that has the potential to work for President Bush and against Mr. Clinton, the victory in the Persian Gulf war lingers as much as any place else in the country. Issue of Race</p><p>And then there is race. It is a stark view of how much the South has changed and how much it has remained the same.</p><p>In the primaries, with Democrats all courting black voters and Republicans seldom disagreeing on racial issues, race is seldom an issue the way it always is in the general elections, but it is still an inescapable part of Southern politics.</p><p>For the Democrats it comes out in the degree to which any credible candidate has to appeal to black voters. With Mr. Clinton having a head start on enlisting the support of prominent blacks in the region, Mr. Kerrey and Paul E. Tsongas, the former Senator from Massachusetts, made earnest efforts this week to draw attention to endorsements by lesser-known black officials. Chance of a Renewed Fight</p><p>For the Republicans, there is always the chance of refighting the region's racial battles. Mr. Buchanan has already raised the issue of racial quotas, saying President Bush caved in by signing the Civil Rights bill last year. Many think the issue is likely to continue.</p><p>"Pat is more Southern than many white Southerners when it comes to race," said Hodding Carter 3d, the Southern journalist and author and former official in Jimmy Carter's Administration. "I think he's going to play that card hard, and if he doesn't he's a fool. As long as he's painted and is happy to be painted as an extremist, he might as well take advantage of it.."</p><p>Still, Mr. Carter says Mr. Buchanan faces a rough road because of another cultural value: the degree to which Southerners tend to respect authority and the office of the President. Despite George Wallace's old plea for voter to "send them a message," Mr. Carter said Southern voters, particularly those likely to vote in the Republican primary, are less likely to follow that path than were voters in New Hampshire.</p><p>"You tend to go more with the established leadership in the South," Mr. Carter said. "That's just a fact. It's got to be really bad times to mobilize a revolt against those already in authority."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
