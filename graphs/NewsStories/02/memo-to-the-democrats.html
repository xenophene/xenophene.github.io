But for the Democratic candidate to defeat Bush and govern successfully, he must compellingly draw the connections between the Republican foreign policy and the insolvency that is sapping the country's strength. Suddenly, it is possible to depict George Bush as weak, an apostle of decline, while the Democratic nominee can present himself as the tribune of American strength and renewal. The Democrats, at last, have available to them potent themes -- progress versus paralysis, strength versus weakness. But their full political force can be brought to bear only by making the foreign policy case. THE THEMES</p><p>The Democratic candidates must do more than claim the rhetoric of change. They must also display the substance that is the emblem of confidence and readiness. There are several central concepts that can provide the Democratic campaign -- and Presidency -- with a galvanizing sense of purpose.</p><p>The Democrats, to begin with, have neglected their own legacy, the legacy of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who forged a synthesis of idealism and realism and balanced the domestic and international agendas. Many of the candidates fatally assume that the path to success is to assign foreign policy to Bush (negative) and reserve domestic policy (positive) for themselves. With the end of the cold war, they seem relieved not to have to deal with foreign affairs.</p><p>But this is a staggering illusion. If they fail to redefine foreign policy, they will not only make themselves defenseless before Bush's attacks; without a new foreign policy, their hopes for the revival of domestic policy will be frustrated by continuing budget deficits. Quite simply, a new domestic agenda is impossible without a more realistic and less costly foreign one. While the candidates have put forward individual proposals, mostly for defense cuts, these in themselves do not constitute a foreign policy. What is missing at the beginning of a new era is the Rooseveltian imperative: the need for a new internationalism.</p><p>But the new internationalism must be based on the dictum of the great columnist Walter Lippmann. During World War II, while F.D.R. drafted plans for the postwar world, Lippmann laid down the cardinal principle of foreign policy: "Without the controlling principle that the nation must maintain its objectives and its power in equilibrium," he wrote, "its purposes within its means and its means equal to its purposes, its commitments related to its resources and its resources adequate to its commitments, it is impossible to think at all about foreign affairs." Insolvency, according to Lippmann, must eventually lead to nothing less than "disaster." It is this prospect that now faces Bush -- and the country.</p><p>During the cold war, our means expanded to meet expanded ends. Now our ends -- a crusade against "instability" and "uncertainty" -- are defined by the President so broadly and vaguely that they defy practical meaning. By the same token, the means to fight the cold war have not been remade to fit any new strategy. By failing to right an economy that has led the United States in less than a decade from being a creditor to a debtor nation that owes the world half a trillion dollars, Bush has violated the solvency principle. Through the peculiar combination of utopian rhetoric and myopic tactics that he substitutes for a foreign policy, the President is incapable of offering anything more than symbolic gestures to deal with the anarchic disorder that horrifies him.</p><p>Bush does not grasp the crisis into which he has plunged the country. But even if he did, his partisan commitments would make it virtually impossible for him to voice even a hint of understanding; for that would demand a searching critique of the past 12 years. Democrats should stress that Bush can no more break with the policy of insolvency than he can break from his party. The two have become one and the same. His Presidency, perforce, must lead to decline.</p><p>The Democrats should also hammer at the point that a second Bush term may well leave America ready to cede its place as the first economic power to Japan and soon thereafter to a united Europe led by Germany. On every major issue, the Democratic nominee should emphasize that the election will be a choice between decline and change, weakness and strength.</p><p>These are the themes. The next step is to translate them into concrete proposals that can emerge as campaign issues. We believe there are four central foreign policy issues that play into the Democrats' hands. THE ISSUES</p><p>NATO. The notion that Russia or the Commonwealth of Independent States is poised to send tank columns crashing through the Fulda Gap is patently absurd. Equally obvious is the fact that NATO has become obsolete. As an enormous, cold war military alliance, it is hardly configured to cope with the security needs of the new Europe. These include thwarting the rise of authoritarian regimes through military coups, intervening in civil wars and preventing existing boundaries from being altered by force. Still, the President stubbornly holds fast to the past, discouraging even a modest proposal by France and Germany to expand their joint military force to 50,000 troops from 4,200. Worse, by continuing to finance the anachronistic ends of the old order, Bush is deepening insolvency.</p><p>In his 1992 budget, President Bush calls for actual defense spending of more than $300 billion, and a five-year defense spending plan of $1.15 trillion (including the $50 billion in cuts outlined in his State of the Union address) -- numbers not adduced from any strategy but out of thin air. These projections are still loosely based on the now-phantom objectives of containing and deterring the defunct Soviet Union. Although the President has proposed withdrawing substantial numbers of troops from Europe, he plans to move them to the United States. This represents no savings at all; indeed, the costs of maintaining them at home may well be higher. At the very least, we will continue to allocate about half the defense budget -- some $150 billion -- to NATO's antiquarian defense of Europe.</p><p>Rather than clinging to a Western alliance that is directed at an invisible threat, the Democrats should propose a new European and Atlantic security organization that would include what remains of the former Soviet Union and the former Warsaw Pact countries, and insure that limited numbers of American troops remain on the continent with a purpose. The number of American troops could run as low as perhaps 50,000 -- the number is not a theological question -- but they would be there with a new mission. The central premise of the successor organization to NATO would be to assure Europeans that aggression by any country against its neighbor would be met with a united response.</p><p>Perhaps the most important element of the new alliance would be to compel the militaries of former Communist states to cooperate with their United States and European counterparts. Permanent participation in the multinational organization would lead inevitably to the democratic reform of the old military structures and mentalities, as occurred in the case of postwar Germany. The economic assimilation of eastern Europe into the West must be linked to military assimilation. Large-scale economic aid in the future would be contingent on military inclusion in the new security organization.</p><p>The establishment of a new Western alliance would be the rough analogue of the Marshall Plan and the founding of NATO -- the foundation for peace. It would also be the single greatest action in helping to bring our ends in line with our means. With savings of at least $150 billion (between $316 billion and $619 billion cumulatively for the rest of the decade, according to a Brookings Institution study), money would become available to support the numerous Democratic proposals to revitalize the nation, from health care to education to public works.</p><p>THE NUCLEAR THREAT. Our greatest military security threat today comes not from the weapons of the declared nuclear powers but from the proliferation of nuclear weapons to other countries -- North Korea, Iraq, Pakistan. Bush has rhetorically acknowledged the problem but has taken no effective steps to reduce the threat. He emphatically refuses to sign the comprehensive test-ban treaty, which is essential to induce the remaining nonnuclear countries to sign the nonproliferation treaty.</p><p>The Democrats should promise to sign the test-ban treaty, and further propose a suspension of economic aid to any nation that refuses to sign the nonproliferation treaty. The Democrats should point out that this policy would make it easier to isolate "crazy states" like Iraq from the start -- an alternative to Bush's early appeasement.</p><p>Having at last acknowledged the end of the cold war, and fitfully moving to reduce strategic nuclear warheads to perhaps as low as 4,700, Bush nonetheless has no strategic rationale for his numbers. The Democrats should argue for a policy of "minimum deterrence," which would mean reducing the long-range warheads on both sides to a minimum number, about 1,000 on each side and signing the test-ban treaty. Once again, the correct policy is also the less expensive policy, which allows Democrats to stand for growth and regeneration at home as well as strength and security abroad. In all this, Bush has again provided Democrats with a prime campaign issue, if only they would seize it.</p><p>BLOOD, SAND AND OIL. Bush will no doubt try to capitalize on the Persian Gulf war, which most Democrats opposed. So the Presidential candidates will have to concede that Bush achieved two of his aims: securing the Saudi frontier, thus thwarting Saddam's potential hegemony over the price of oil, and wresting Kuwait from Saddam. But they should stress how badly the President lost the peace. In retrospect, it appears that Bush went to war to make the Persian Gulf safe for feudalism. Not only was Saddam permitted to remain in power, he also was allowed to butcher Kurds and Shiites while our forces stood by.</p><p>The Arab-Israeli peace conference is one of the main means by which Bush is trying to justify the gulf war, as if the obligations incurred on all sides can yield a general conciliation. Certainly, it is praiseworthy to take up where Jimmy Carter's Camp David diplomacy left off. The conference may offer some promise of an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians on the West Bank for some form of autonomy and self-government. But it is hard to envision much else. In this respect, Bush risks American prestige on arranging a highly unlikely general peace that, should it fail, will arouse bitterness throughout the Middle East.</p><p>In any event, the Democratic candidates should stress that the gulf war belongs to the past, and they should emphasize where the war has left us strategically. In the world's most dangerously unstable region, the Administration has committed the United States as the guarantor of the balance of power. Hence, with no new world order in sight, the President seems on the verge of committing us to a longstanding and entangling involvement.</p><p>An alternative must include making a strong case for energy independence. Besides the obvious economic and environmental benefits, a renewed energy policy can be used to reduce the leverage the Persian Gulf states exercise over United States policy in the region. Once again, the Democratic candidates should expose Bush's posture of strength as a veneer for a deeper weakness. He is losing the future because he is bound to the past.</p><p>TRADE WARS. These days, most Americans feel more threatened by foreign trade than foreign military power. While ideologically committed to free trade, Bush has slid into a simplistic, unthinking version of "managed trade," extracting promises of foreign purchases in return for access to American markets. The Bush Administration's only other trade policy is to drive down the value of the dollar in an effort to make our goods cheaper. But a weak currency does not translate into a strong economy.</p><p>American voters consistently reject protectionist policies, sensibly recognizing that they sacrifice at least as many jobs as they save and that the reality of a global economy cannot be wished away. Thus, the Democrats should simply call for a "level playing field" and, once again, emphasize that it is the misguided Bush who is leading the country away from that goal.</p><p>The Democratic nominee should also strive to explain the cold war bargain that has landed us in this predicament. In the early cold war years, Washington actually granted allies, like Japan, special trade favors and access to our technology in return for allowing us to set up bases on their soil and provide for their security. In recent years, America has borne the exorbitant costs of maintaining a global military establishment in return for foreign capital to maintain the deficit that drains our ability to rejuvenate ourselves.</p><p>While the rest of the advanced economic powers engage in industrial strategies, Bush adheres to the myth of laissez faire. His ideological references to the strength of frontier individualism (a pose struck to fend off his right wing) obscure the actual insolvent bargain he has struck -- and his own reactive protectionism. Democrats should stress that as long as Bush clings to a foreign policy of insolvency, America can't hope to reverse the erosion of its technology, infrastructure and standard of living.</p><p>Clearly, the world needs new economic and financial institutions to replace or augment the trading system that was set up after World War II at Bretton Woods. There are no common rules for antitrust, dumping, subsidies or copyright of intellectual property, among other things. Without them, countries with coherent industrial strategies will always have an advantage. Free trade will not come about by ignoring these differences, nor by incantations of Ronald Reagan's rhetoric. Yet the ultimate practitioner of "voodoo economics" is none other than the one who gave it its fitting name.</p><p>GEORGE BUSH, unfortunately, is a man of the past. His reactive, patchwork approach in domestic policy is precisely mirrored in foreign policy. In both realms, Bush's ends are hollow, his means bankrupt. But his failure to conceive a solvent foreign policy is not due mainly to his reactive approach. By training and experience, Bush was admirably prepared to lead the United States in tactical, cold war maneuvering of the sort that has become obsolete. But his world view is now an anachronism. Further, he can hardly be expected to lead against the very policies of national paralysis he has promulgated for more than a decade. He has no choice but to take his place as the standard-bearer of decline.</p><p>The task of the Democratic Presidential candidate is to make clear just how costly it will be at home and abroad to continue with Bush's insolvent regime. In the triumphal aftermath of the cold war, George Bush is presiding over the dissolution of the American Century.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-contributor" style="" class="mod-nytimescontributor"><!-- Module starts: contributor (Contributor) -->Sidney Blumenthal, a senior editor at The New Republic, is the author of "Pledging Allegiance: The Last Campaign of the Cold War."
