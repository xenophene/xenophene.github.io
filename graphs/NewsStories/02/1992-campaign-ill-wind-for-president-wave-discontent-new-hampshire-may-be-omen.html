Nearly half of them felt dissatisfied enough with George Bush's performance, especially his handling of the economy, to vote for a television commentator, Patrick J. Buchanan, in preference to the incumbent President.</p><p>The question is: Will Republicans elsewhere feel and do the same? And will Mr. Bush's evident weakness, together with the rather indecisive outcome of the Democratic primary, propel other Democrats into the contest?</p><p>It was a bad day for the status quo. Not only did Mr. Bush suffer from voters' wrath; the winner among the Democrats, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas, was a man who has been out of office for eight years and ran against politics-as-usual.</p><p>Mr. Buchanan had a lot of advantages in New Hampshire that will not be available to him in subsequent contests, including those in Georgia on March 3 and Texas on March 10, which he has described as his next targets. This state has been hit harder than almost any by the recession. Television advertising is cheap here, an advantage to a challenger, and Mr. Buchanan had the exuberant backing of the state's dominant newspaper, The Union Leader in Manchester.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-first-para--></div><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ln-ctr-top" style="" class="mod-nytimesline mod-line"><!-- Module starts: ln-ctr-top (Line) --><center><div style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc; height:1px; width:350px;"></div></center><!-- Module ends: ln-ctr-top--></div><!-- Area starts: main-center-center --><div id="area-main-center-center" style=""><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ctr-lt-in-top" style="float:left;" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-lt-in-top (AdCpc) -->

'Contagious' Anger</p><p>"The anger expressed by our electorate is contagious, and it will travel," said Thomas Rath, a former state attorney general who was one of the President's main advisers here. "New Hampshire provides the context for what comes next. The White House has to figure out some way to change the mood of the country very quickly, or the President will be in serious trouble."</p><p>Clearly, Mr. Buchanan was the recipient of many protest votes. According to a survey of voters leaving polling places, about half of the challenger's supporters said they had backed him mainly to "send a message." About half of those who voted for Mr. Buchanan today said that if he were nominated, they would vote for Mr. Bush in November.</p><p>Even after Mr. Buchanan's near-triumph today, politicians and political analysts see him less as a threat to Mr. Bush's renomination, which most of them take for granted, and more as a threat to Mr. Bush's eventual re-election. The longer he stays in the race, they say, the more he distracts the President from the main business at hand, fighting the Democrats.</p><p>But then Mr. Buchanan has been underestimated before, notably by the White House political operatives. The candidate's sister, Angela, who heads his campaign, says she is confident that $2 million can be raised in a matter of days to finance the next phase of his effort.</p><p>Tonight, Mr. Buchanan appealed for tens of thousands of volunteers in Maryland, Florida and South Carolina, indicating that he planned to run in the primaries there next month as well as those in Georgia and Texas.</p><p>Mr. Bush's backers sought to dismiss the New Hampshire results as an aberration. For example, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, a conservative Republican, said, "The President is going to win every primary, and his margin is going to get larger as we go along." Mr. Buchanan, he asserted, would achieve nothing in Texas because he lacked the time and the money to assemble a campaign there. Not a 'Tidal Wave'</p><p>"What this was not is a tidal wave of support for Pat Buchanan as the next President of the United States," said Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., who was a White House political director during the Reagan Administration.</p><p>What it was was "a primal scream," said Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, a sometime ally of Mr. Buchanan who is backing the President this time. But the breadth of support for Mr. Buchanan was remarkable, apparently coming close to the 41.9 percent that Senator Eugene J. McCarthy polled against Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968; it was that embarrassment that forced Mr. Johnson from the race.</p><p>To be sure, the economic issue of 1992 is less corrosive than Vietnam was in 1968. But Kevin Phillips, a conservative analyst, described Mr. Buchanan's challenge to Mr. Bush as the most serious to an elected Republican president since 1912, when Theodore Roosevelt broke with the incumbent, William Howard Taft, to challenge him under the Bull Moose party banner.</p><p>A fierce debate over tactics is likely before the Georgia primary, in which Mr. Gingrich expects Mr. Buchanan to poll at least 30 percent of the total. Speaking for many others, Mr. Rath argued, "You can't let Buchanan get away, as he did here, without facing the scrutiny and criticism real candidates face."</p><p>Deciding what approach to take next will be a big test for Mr. Bush's campaign organization, led by Robert M. Teeter and Richard N. Bond. Its performance here looked like that of a team forced into a big game in the midst of spring training -- reflexes slow, too many strikeouts in the clutch. Their inept performance is an embarrassment, but they still have plenty of time to recover for the playoffs.</p><p>Almost universally, Republican leaders expect the White House to move rapidly now to emphasize middle-class tax relief. Mr. Bush's ambiguous performance on that issue gave Mr. Buchanan a huge opening here and put the President on the defensive during his final campaign swing.</p><p>"The President has to get his message clear, and he has to get out and convince people that he wants to be re- elected, not because of what he has done but what he wants to do," said Edward Rollins, a prominent Republican strategist who also served in the White House under President Reagan.</p><p>Mr. Bush's bloody nose may encourage new Democratic candidacies. Even among Republican voters here, only 48 percent approved of his performance as President, with 49 percent disapproving. But the Democratic results, with Mr. Tsongas winning and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas running a respectable second, send no clear message.</p><p>While Mr. Clinton did less well than he had hoped before his campaign was swamped for a time by accusations of marital infidelity and draft evasion, which he denied, he did well enough to head toward the South, his natural base, with his head high. He did equally well among men and women here, and only 5 percent of the Democratic voters said that questions about Mr. Clinton's character influenced the way they voted, according to the survey of voters.</p><p>The Arkansan now faces a stern test. He must demonstrate in the next month in the culturally and politically conservative South that the accusations don't cut there, either. If he can, restive national Democratic leaders, many of whom continue to view Mr. Clinton as a damaged political property, may change their minds.</p><p>Mr. Tsongas won about a third of the vote, according to the survey of voters. It was a remarkable achievement for a man whose announcement of candidacy was greeted with derision. But he comes from neighboring Massachusetts, so the professionals discounted it, to some degree, as a regional phenomenon.</p><p>It will take a few weeks, probably until Maryland votes on March 3 and possibly until Super Tuesday, March 10, when 11 states vote, to answer the question of whether Mr. Tsongas's political magic can be exported.</p><p>During that time, in the primaries in South Dakota and elsewhere, the second tier of Democratic candidates -- former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, who did much better than expected, and Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska -- will vie to see which of them survives. Their blanket finish here meant that New Hampshire's traditional winnowing function was frustrated.</p><p>Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri or Senator Al Gore of Tennessee may decide in the next few days to make a late entry. Frank Watkins, an aide to Jesse Jackson, the civil rights leader, called reporters today to suggest that his man was "under pressure to run." It is even possible that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York might jump in, though the write-in campaign in his behalf did not really catch fire.</p><p>With so many questions still open, however, a late entrant might well be seen as a spoiler or worse, and it seems more likely that everyone will wait to see whether any of the active contenders demonstrates staying power.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
