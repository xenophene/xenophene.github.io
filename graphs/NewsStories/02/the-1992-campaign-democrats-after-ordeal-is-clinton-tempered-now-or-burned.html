But for public consumption, Mr. Clinton acts more worried about his weight -- "I'm getting fat as a wood tick" -- than the fate of his campaign, even though, as he says with a grim smile, "the money merchants are still combing the back alleys."</p><p>It has been a week since he was strafed by what the aides commissioned to generate sympathy for him call "tabloid terrorism," and he watched his campaign teeter amid charges by Gennifer Flowers in the newspaper Star that he had a 12-year affair with her and helped her get an Arkansas state job, an account he denies.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-first-para--></div><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ln-ctr-top" style="" class="mod-nytimesline mod-line"><!-- Module starts: ln-ctr-top (Line) --><center><div style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc; height:1px; width:350px;"></div></center><!-- Module ends: ln-ctr-top--></div><!-- Area starts: main-center-center --><div id="area-main-center-center" style=""><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ctr-lt-in-top" style="float:left;" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-lt-in-top (AdCpc) -->

And Mr. Clinton has begun to suggest that voters will relate to his confession of imperfection. Keeping Worries at Bay</p><p>"Have you heard that song, 'I Ain't Going to Worry No More' by Ray Charles and Ronnie Milsap?" Mr. Clinton asks reporters traveling on his small plane, singing a few bars in a voice hoarse from allergies. "That should be our campaign song. As long as there's moonlight in Virginia, there ain't nothing to worry about."</p><p>Mr. Clinton's poll taker, Stan Greenberg, put it differently, but no less hopefully. He said that as long as voters believed the candidate had not lied and that his marriage was "real," that they will not turn on him.</p><p>Hillary Clinton, in vivid appearances on television and in the latest campaign commercials, has tried to foster the image of a "genuine" marriage, Mr. Greenberg said.</p><p>"I'm not sure people aren't right when they say she is the one who ought to be running," Mr. Clinton said of his wife, in an interview here before the Democratic debate on Friday. "You know, we like each other. You can watch me watch her speak sometimes, and I've got the Nancy Reagan adoring look."</p><p>"I think she's one good argument for voting for me," he added.</p><p>Mr. Clinton launched into a stream-of-consciousness tribute: "If the choice for us, is my having gotten a divorce a couple years ago and being single and going up to New Hampshire and winnning and being free of this almost unbelievable set of behaviors to which I and my family and our friends have been subjected, but ultimately being nominated and going on to the White House, or just going home to the rest of my life with her and Chelsea, I think now everybody in America ought to be able to see why I would choose to go home.</p><p>"I think she's just been extraordinary," he said in a rare reference to the embarrassing situation his wife has faced. "One of the reasons that I guess I'm in elected office and she isn't is, she's always wanted to guard her privacy much more, and I've always kind of hated to have to discuss some of the things that we have discussed in the last few weeks. If I learned anything it's like every other challenge that I've ever seen her face, she was able to rise to it."</p><p>He said he and Chelsea watched his wife's appearance on "Prime Time Live" on Thursday night. "Kids today, if they're given the kind of emotional support they need, if they know they're important and they're good and their folks are committed to them, they can deal with reality better sometimes than we think they can," he said.</p><p>Mr. Clinton says he believes it will be ineffective for his opponents to try to turn his confession of past troubles in his marriage into a political noose.</p><p>"Most people down deep inside always want to do better, and most people down deep inside know that we're all imperfect, that even the very best lives are a daily lifelong struggle for integrity, for continuing to do better," he said, sinking back in the seat of a car taking him from airport to hotel. "Remember that great story about Oliver Wendell Holmes in his 90's, and a law clerk asked him why he was straining his eyes reading an old dog-eared copy of 'Plato's Republic'? And he said, 'I'm doing it to improve my mind.'</p><p>"I feel that way about character. It's about the continuing search for belief and conviction and action and the ability not to disappoint yourself as well as others. It's a lifelong process. And I think that people know that different folks have different difficulties to deal with, but they identify with people who seem to be on the journey."</p><p>On the road, Mr. Clinton's manner is in stark contrast to that of Gary Hart, after the charges involving Donna Rice charges erupted in his Presidential campaign.</p><p>Where Mr. Hart would cringe whenever anyone would try to take his picture with an attractive blonde, Mr. Clinton does not censor his behavior. When a pretty blonde with a black puppy came up to the candidate in Hampton, N.H., the other day, the pack of photographers exploded in a burst of picture-taking fervor.</p><p>Mr. Clinton did not rush, and took several minutes to talk to the young woman and cuddle her puppy. The 'Elvis' Look</p><p>When his former classmate at Yale Law School, Douglas Eakley, introduced Mr. Clinton at a fund-raising event in West Orange, N.J., on Wednesday night by saying that they had shared a bachelor pad on the beach in their first year at Yale, the audience giggled and ooohhhed, and Mr. Eakley chastised them, "Can't you get your mind on the issues?"</p><p>The candidate was not flustered. He offered his trademark "Elvis" look, featured heavily in his commercials, of biting his lower lip and crinkling his eyes a bit, a look meant to convey an appealing combination of decency and deviltry.</p><p>"Elvis," he explained later, "was the major cultural figure of my childhood and my neighbor in Mississippi and later in Memphis. I like the comparisons."</p><p>On the plane, when he was not reading articles about his campaign, he tried, as usual, to charm every man and woman in his path, finding just the right compliment or common ground for each.</p><p>In the middle of a photo session at a T-shirt factory in Salem, N.N., Mr. Clinton caught the eye of Patrick Bruchet, a photographer for the magazine Paris Match, and took several moments to discuss the theory of French socialism and health plans in the books of Jacques Attali, the former economic adviser to President Francois Mitterrand.</p><p>The Clinton campaign has the eerie feeling of a drama being played out in two dimensions: At stops this week in New Hampshire, New Jersey and Arkansas, the professed feeling among aides was that Mr. Clinton has triumphed in the first round against the tabloids.</p><p>The Clinton campaign was a din of spin. James Carville, the fast-talking gonzo strategist wearing jeans with holes so large his underwear was leaking out in the back, pinned reporters to their chairs with a wall of words. "In Washington, you get stories that this is a beleaguered campaign. WOW! No! No! No! People in Washington are not people. They're human beings and all, but they're not people. Washington is never right about anything. Even a broken clock is right twice a day. Look at the polls -- have you ever seen a front-runner get out of the race?"</p><p>But in Washington, Democratic Party leaders and elected officials were very nervous and fearful that there could be another slipper yet to drop.</p><p>Could one more disclosure tilt voters against the candidate? Is there a subterranean Puritanism that public opinion polls are not picking up right now?</p><p>Democrats and Republicans are divided about whether Mr. Clinton has been fatally wounded, or whether he has shrewdly inoculated himself. Barbs Grow Sharper</p><p>Mr. Clinton's Democratic opponents, seemingly frantic at not being able to get any traction from his troubles, grew sharper as the week wore on.</p><p>On Wednesday night, John Durkin, a former New Hampshire Senator, introduced Senator Tom Harkin at a labor rally in Manchester, saying, "I don't care much about Bill Clinton's infidelity in his domstic life." But Mr. Durkin said he did care about Mr. Clinton's "infidelity" to the environment, working people and the middle class.</p><p>Senator Bob Kerrey, who is divorced, raised the subject by complaining that Mr. Clinton had implied that working out a troubled marriage was morally preferable to parting. "I reject the pious notion that one is either perfect or divorced," he told The Boston Globe.</p><p>Mr. Clinton said Mr. Kerrey had misunderstood him.</p><p>"The only point I tried to make is that having said that it's okay for divorced people to be President, we shouldn't go in the other direction and say if you've ever had troubles in your marriage and you want to run for office, just forget it," he said. "But I was never negative on Bob Kerrey for getting divorced. As a matter of fact, when my mother remarried my stepfather, I was against her doing it. I think sometimes divorce is not only appropriate, it is the only sensible thing to do in life."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
