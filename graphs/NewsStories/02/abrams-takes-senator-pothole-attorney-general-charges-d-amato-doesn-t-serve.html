So it can be jarring to watch him run for the Democratic nomination for the Senate, attacking Alfonse M. D'Amato, the Republican Senator known for old-style pork-barrel politics. Mr. Abrams is proposing to out-D'Amato Mr. D'Amato.</p><p>Senator D'Amato "has cut and hurt and punished New York," Mr. Abrams told reporters he summoned in late January to the modest Nassau County home of Ken and Betty Koch -- "middle-class people," he said -- to shift his year-old campaign into high gear. Partly because of Mr. D'Amato, he said, New York receives fewer dollars back than it sends to Washington in taxes. "And Al D'Amato has the gall to say that he has delivered for New York," Mr. Abrams said.</p><p>Mr. Abrams is engaged in a close race for the nomination. He is opposed by four other Democrats: Geraldine A. Ferraro, Elizabeth Holtzman, Robert J. Mrazek and the Rev. Al Sharpton.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-first-para--></div><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ln-ctr-top" style="" class="mod-nytimesline mod-line"><!-- Module starts: ln-ctr-top (Line) --><center><div style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc; height:1px; width:350px;"></div></center><!-- Module ends: ln-ctr-top--></div><!-- Area starts: main-center-center --><div id="area-main-center-center" style=""><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ctr-lt-in-top" style="float:left;" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-lt-in-top (AdCpc) -->

"It's time that New York had a senator who is more interested in putting money in your pocket than money in the pockets of his cousins and his cronies," he said. Six months ago the Senate Select Committee on Ethics rebuked Mr. D'Amato for his conduct, but declined to censure him. Mr. D'Amato has been called Senator Pothole for his service to constituents.</p><p>In interviews and before groups, Mr. Abrams repeatedly promised to bring in more Federal money and criticized Mr. D'Amato for not doing so. Mr. D'Amato, he said, "has tried to create the image that he has brought home the bacon for New York, but that's a sham, it's a lie, it's a fraud."</p><p>Then Mr. Abrams would turn around and tout himself as an idealistic, independent force. "My agenda has always been one of change, of progressive social values and political reform," he said. That Mr. Abrams is running as both a crusading independent and a committed pork-barreler, as both "the only candidate who has not served in Congress" and the candidate best qualified to win dollars playing "the big game in town," is one of several apparent contradictions in his campaign. Despite his changed circumstances, Mr. Abrams, at 54, appears to be running an updated version of every race he has run since he was a young man.</p><p>Mr. Abrams is a career politician running as an outsider.</p><p>He is an innovative official pushing proposals that seem warmed over from other campaigns.</p><p>To his opponents, these contradictions reek of opportunism. "Bob Abrams will say just about anything," Mr. D'Amato said through a spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha, who said that Mr. D'Amato would comment directly on Mr. Abrams only if he won the nomination. A Dissonant Message?</p><p>Advisers to Mr. Abrams's opponents say that his dissonant message has made him vulnerable. "There's not a big impression in people's minds of who Bob Abrams is," said Frank Wilkinson, a spokesman for Ms. Ferraro, the 1984 Democratic Vice Presidential candidate. Polls conducted by the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion in spring 1991 showed Mr. Abrams comfortably in front, but a survey by the institute a month ago put him and Ms. Ferraro in a virtual tie. He had the support of 27.4 percent of respondents, compared with 27.1 percent for her.</p><p>Ms. Holtzman, the New York City Comptroller, received 20.2 percent in the poll; Mr. Mrazek, a United States Representative from Long Island, got 3.1 percent, and Mr. Sharpton got 2.3 percent. Twenty percent of respondents were undecided.</p><p>To Mr. Abrams, the contradictions are more evidence of his independence. While they may seem stark, they begin to blur on closer examination. Mr. Abrams does seem to be something of all things to all Democrats: an inside player who has retained certain ideals and an advocate of abstract principles who believes in doing the gritty work of making government meet individual needs.</p><p>The son of a Bronx candy store owner, Mr. Abrams said that he "came up the hard way," working four jobs a day during college at Columbia. After graduating from New York University Law School, he won election as a state assemblyman in 1965, then as Bronx borough president in 1970. Both victories were upsets against an entrenched Democratic organization.</p><p>But what Mr. Abrams's Reform Democrat slate offered was not no machine, but a clean machine; not no pork, but more pork. "It's going to be up to me to persuade the Board of Estimate to make its proper and appropriate investment in Bronx County," he said during his run for borough president.</p><p>Mr. Abrams won the Attorney General's office in 1978. Since then, he has taken three elections easily, though at first blush he lacks the basic tools for survival in the blow-dried age. The balding Mr. Abrams, who wears glasses, is no backslapper.</p><p>Even in private Mr. Abrams rarely relaxes his theatrical voice and his formal, elaborate sentences. Asked over lunch about his wife, Diane, he pronounced her "a fabulous asset to me in rearing our family, and being a partner in my life and a partner in my career."</p><p>Despite his starched persona, Mr. Abrams invariably comes across as a nice guy. "Bob is the only high-ranking politician in the state who is well liked," said Mark Green, New York City's Consumer Affairs Commissioner and Mr. D'Amato's last opponent. "He's an utterly decent family man in a totally rapacious business."</p><p>Mr. Abrams attributes his political success to his ability to deliver. Wherever he travels in New York, Mr. Abrams said, people "tell me, 'Hey, Mr. Abrams, I got a check from you today!' " He has fought dozens of suits on behalf of New Yorkers, forcing insurers, brewers and others to mail them checks totaling more than $800 million, said his spokesman, Timothy Gilles. Expanding Office's Mission</p><p>Those checks represent dividends from Mr. Abrams's efforts to expand his office's capacity and mission. As the Department of Justice retreated under Ronald Reagan from antitrust and environmental prosecutions, aggressive state attorneys general, including Mr. Abrams and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, stepped into the breach. Mr. Abrams intensified his office's efforts against tax cheats and consumer frauds and tackled new areas, prosecuting polluters, such as the company that poisoned Love Canal.</p><p>"He really over the years has set a standard for state attorneys general around the country," said Mr. Lieberman, now a Democratic senator.</p><p>But Mr. Abrams's high-profile prosecutions have also spawned the most persistent criticism of him: that he picks his battles for their publicity value.</p><p>Mr. Abrams's supporters point out that even if the criticism were true, a desire for good press would hardly distinguish Mr. Abrams from other politicians. Two lobbyists for liberal causes, who insisted on anonymity, cited recent instances when Mr. Abrams agreed not to sponsor legislation he favored. They said that Republican legislators would fight any measure that might help Mr. Abrams beat Mr. D'Amato, and getting the bills passed meant more to Mr. Abrams than receiving credit. 'Hindsight' on Gulf War</p><p>But critics say Mr. Abrams is not always so inner-directed, and a tendency to skirt tough confrontations has popped up during his campaign. When he declared his candidacy, Mr. Abrams was asked whether he would have voted to authorize war against Iraq. He dodged, saying he did not have as much information as sitting senators. The war won, Mr. Abrams said that with "hindsight" he supported the decision to fight it.</p><p>Like his opponents, Mr. Abrams has put forward few specifics for his campaign's central proposals, which include a universal health care system and a tax cut for the middle class. Mr. Abrams's freshest plank appears to be his claim that Mr. D'Amato has not served constituents well. The reason, he said, is that Mr. D'Amato voted for policies of President Bush and Ronald Reagan that resulted in less money for New Yorkers.</p><p>But economists are not convinced by the evidence he cites. "For 1990," Mr. Abrams said, offering his chief piece of data, "there was a $21 billion shortfall of what we as New Yorkers sent to the Federal Government and of what came back."</p><p>That number was plucked from a study by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. As the study noted, the chief reason for the Federal Government's deficit with New York is that New Yorkers are wealthier than most Americans and so pay more taxes.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
