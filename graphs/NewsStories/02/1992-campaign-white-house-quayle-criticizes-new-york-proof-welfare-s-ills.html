"In man's economic life, the state may be an uneasy ally, but I don't think it's ever a friend," he said. [ Excerpt, page A18. ] A List of Problems</p><p>Addresssing the club members during a dinner at the New York Hilton at Rockefeller Center, Mr. Quayle recited a list of New York's problems, including high city and state taxes, a large number of people on the welfare rolls and a high drop-out rate for students enrolled in public schools.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-first-para--></div><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ln-ctr-top" style="" class="mod-nytimesline mod-line"><!-- Module starts: ln-ctr-top (Line) --><center><div style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc; height:1px; width:350px;"></div></center><!-- Module ends: ln-ctr-top--></div><!-- Area starts: main-center-center --><div id="area-main-center-center" style=""><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ctr-lt-in-top" style="float:left;" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-lt-in-top (AdCpc) -->

Buchanan. Mr. Bush's opponent will not be on the New York ballot in the Republican primary.</p><p>Mr. Quayle's stinging words were greeted with support from his audience but anger from several city and state officials, who mainatin that the last two Republican administrations were responsible for the severe budget crunch.</p><p>Mr. Quayle's comments sounded like the campaign themes that he and President Bush would have used against Mario M. Cuomo if the New York Governor had run for President. Even as a noncandidate, Mr. Cuomo is extremely irritating to Bush Administration officials, and they love to assail him and his policies.</p><p>"Predictably, the Republicans feel more comfortable with negative attacks because the alternative would be to highlight their own record on which they are most vulnerable," said Anne W. Crowley, press secretary to Mr. Cuomo. "But they cannot talk about the problems of any city in the nation without acknowledging their own failures."</p><p>In response to a question at the dinner, Mr. Quayle said he would welcome an opportunity to run with President Bush against a Democratic ticket headed by Governor Cuomo.</p><p>"Mario's not running," Mr. Quayle said. "But if he does run, it would be a lot of fun." Mr. Quayle predicted that if Mr. Cuomo does run for President, "one of the first states to vote to re-elect President George Bush will be the State of New York." Emphasizing Welfare Rolls</p><p>Bush Administration officials say the President and Mr. Quayle intend to emphasize welfare as a political issue in this election year, on the assumption that voters from middle-income families will be hostile to generous welfare programs at a time of economic difficulties in the United States. In his State of the Union Message last month, Mr. Bush said: "Welfare was never meant to be a lifestyle; it was never meant to be a habit; it was never supposed to be passed from generation to generation like a legacy. It's time to replace the assumptions of the welfare state and help reform the welfare system."</p><p>In an impassioned speech at Harvard University two weeks ago, Mr. Cuomo urged the Bush Administration not to exploit welfare as a political issue. Overheated talk about public assistance "would appeal to and feed a sad, corrosive instinct for negativism and divisiveness," the Governor said. Criticism From Officials</p><p>Leland Jones, Mayor David N. Dinkins's press secretary, said: "I think it's regrettable that Mr. Quayle appears to want to out-Buchanan Buchanan. For if the Bush-Quayle vision worked, the Kurds would not have been driven out of their homeland, and the American economy would not have been driven into depression."</p><p>State and local officials have acknowledged many of the problems mentioned by the Vice President but say much of the blame belongs to the Reagan and Bush Administrations, which have cut Federal aid to cities at a time when a host of new urban problems were requiring them to provide a vast array of new services.</p><p>New York, the officials often note, suffers a huge balance of payment deficit with the Federal Government. An annual study conducted by the office of Senator Daniel P. Moynihan, the New York Democrat, last year found that the state in fiscal year 1990 suffered the fifth-largest deficit with the Federal Government in the country, sending Washington $21.2 billion more than it received. That was $1,178 per New Yorker. By contrast, New Mexicans enjoyed a surplus of $2,776 per capita, a total of $4.2 billion.</p><p>A spokesman for Mr. Moynihan, a national authority on welfare, said the Senator did not want to comment because he had not studied Mr. Quayle's speech. The Senator is to introduce a bill Friday aimed at reducing welfare dependency, which creates a cycle of poverty by sapping the initiative of welfare recipients to become productive members of society.</p><p>But the Vice President's comments were praised by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican, who is making "welfare cheats" and what he calls the state's exceedingly generous welfare provisions a centerpiece of his effort to win re-election.</p><p>"Unfortunately the Vice President is right and everyone knows it except Mario Cuomo," he said.</p><p>Mr. Quayle's comments came in a wide-ranging speech in which he hailed the end of the cold war, supported free trade, opposed protectionism, defended President Bush's economic recovery plan and denounced Democrats in Congress as supporters of high taxes.</p><p>Earlier today Mr. Quayle visited the office of America Works, a company that has placed 2,500 welfare recipients in jobs at banks, law firms, insurance companies and other businesses.</p><p>The Vice President praised America Works as a "fantastic example" of market-oriented solutions to the problems of unemployment and poverty. He said the Administration wanted to spend $20 million next year to support such job placement operations. Public Money Helped</p><p>Mr. Quayle did not mention that America Works got its start in New York with money and support from the State Department of Social Services. "The Cuomo Administration initiated America Works in New York City," said Peter Cove, founder of the company. "The Department of Social Services pays us to get people off welfare."</p><p>Lee A. Bowes, the chief operating officer of America Works, said the state saves money because it pays $5,000 to her company to help arrange a job for a welfare recipient, as against $15,000 for a year's worth of welfare benefits and related assistance.</p><p>America Works is the only private company the state of New York pays to help welfare recipients find jobs. It will place about 400 workers this year, a tiny proportion of the 170,000 welfare recipients who are required to participate in work or training programs.</p><p>The state pays the company $5,400 for each welfare recipient who holds the job for at least 90 days. City officials praise the company, but note that it is a relatively expensive program.</p><p>"They do get people jobs, which is no small feat," said Catherine Zall, deputy commissioner at the city's Human Resources Administration. New Surges in Welfare</p><p>After showing little growth for almost two decades, the nation's welfare rolls now surge to record levels each month, in part because of the recession. In October, more than 13 million Americans were receiving benefits under the main Fedeal-state welfare program.</p><p>In a meeting with journalists in New York City today, Mr. Quayle acknowledged that "we have a sluggish economy." Indeed, he said: "Jobs have been lost rather than created. We have not been as successful in creating jobs in the last few years as we had hoped."</p><p>Liberal economics may be popular in New York, "but it sure doesn't work here," Mr. Quayle said.</p><p>"In what should be a liberal paradise, what do we find instead?" Mr. Quayle asked. "Honest, ambitious, hard-working New Yorkers struggling to pay the highest local taxes in America, about $1,600 per person. A business tax three times greater than that paid by businesses in Chicago and Los Angeles. One in every eight people on the dole. Taxpayers investing $7,000 a year for each public school student, compared to $3,000 per student in private schools.</p><p>"When the taxpayers meekly protest these high taxes, the liberal deep-thinkers snap back that we lack 'compassion' for the working man. But the working man is usually the one most hurt by this kind of thinking."</p><p>Mr. Quayle said the liberal vision of a welfare state had failed, in New York and elsewhere, because it was based on false premises.</p><p>"You don't build economic strength by taxing economic stength," said Mr. Quayle, the scion of a wealthy family in Indiana. "If you tax wealth, you diminish wealth. If you diminish wealth, you diminish investment. The fewer the investments, the fewer jobs."</p><p>"What a tragedy it would be if America were to lead in the triumph of free-market capitalism" around the world, "only to lose faith in it ourselves," he said.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
