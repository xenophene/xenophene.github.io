Crystal made his presentation. And who could blame them? Mr. Crystal had some fairly harsh things to say about the way C.E.O.'s are compensated. He has been delivering his message with evangelistic fervor for several years, though frequently with all the impact of a pesky mosquito.</p><p>But suddenly he is being courted by the media and widely listened to by politicians, reformers, the public -- and even C.E.O.'s -- thanks mostly to the furor over President Bush's recent trip to Japan. Seeking trade concessions, Mr. Bush was joined by a gaggle of American corporate chieftains whose average compensation last year, in the midst of a protracted recession, was $3.4 million, six times the average for their Japanese counterparts. .</p><p>Mr. Crystal has seized this moment in the limelight, and many corporate heads are furious with him.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-first-para--></div><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ln-ctr-top" style="" class="mod-nytimesline mod-line"><!-- Module starts: ln-ctr-top (Line) --><center><div style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc; height:1px; width:350px;"></div></center><!-- Module ends: ln-ctr-top--></div><!-- Area starts: main-center-center --><div id="area-main-center-center" style=""><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ctr-lt-in-top" style="float:left;" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-lt-in-top (AdCpc) -->

O'Reilly, chairman of H.J. Heinz ($3.6 million in 1990 salary and bonus, plus $71.5 million from stock options granted in prior years), and he wails: "If they gave him one more dime, the 60th floor of the building would collapse."</p><p>What about William A. Anders, chairman of General Dynamics (about $9.4 million in 1991)? "The C.E.O. of General Dynamics must be the laziest man it he world," he clucks. "Look at all the incentive plans they have to give him to go to work in the morning."</p><p>Well, how about Linda J. Wachner, head of Warnaco ($21.4 million in 1990)? "It'd be churlish to become outraged by Wachner's excess, now that she's the only overpaid woman in America," he said.</p><p>The C.E.O.'s do not take Mr. Crystal's remarks lying down, of course. In Evanston, one of them accused Mr. Crystal of slander and later snubbed Mr. Crystal's wife, Sue, when she tried to engage him in small talk. Mr. Crystal became furious in his own right. "From now on," he declared, "no more Mr. Nice Guy." A Course Called Greed</p><p>Nice guy? To the C.E.O.'s who have been dodging Mr. Crystal's blistering barbs, the idea that he could be even more of a gadfly than he already is must have been frightening. "I'm a rebel with a cause," said Mr. Crystal, who teaches an executive compensation course at the University of California in Berkeley known informally as Greed 259A.</p><p>"There's no question that he has sensitized C.E.O.'s to an issue," said David R. Meredith, a compensation consultant who was once a competitor of Mr. Crystal's. "It's really brought the spotlight fully front and center on both the levels of pay and how pay is being done."</p><p>Mr. Crystal's message is a simple one: C.E.O.'s are paid too much in relationship to their companies' performance, and their pay seldom reflects downturns in corporate fortunes. He has become the point man for a growing movement of shareholders, employees, legislators and others who feel executive pay must be reined in if the country is to regain its economic vigor.</p><p>"People are interested in this topic because while the average person is hurting, C.E.O.'s have done very well," said Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who held hearings on the topic Friday. "People know there's something wrong."</p><p>Just as the threat of corporate raiders kept managements on their toes in the 1980's, so there is the threat of Mr. Crystal in the downtrodden 1990's. Mr. Crystal has particular credibility, even with his critics, because he spent the better part of his career advising companies about how to use many of the razzle-dazzle, pay-boosting techniques he now lambastes. "He knows what he's talking about and companies know that, and that's a scary thing," said Abraham Nad, publisher of Directorship, a newsletter in Westport, Conn., that tracks corporate board issues.</p><p>Some companies have begun paying attention. The crusade Mr. Crystal led against the ITT Corporation last year resulted in some concrete changes in the company's incentive plan this year.</p><p>"We certainly felt the pressure and have made prudent reforms," said David H. Rhael, ITT's compensation director. The company switched from giving outright grants of stock to 10-year stock options that cannot be exercised early unless the stock price rises at least 40 percent.</p><p>Other companies are not waiting for Mr. Crystal to show up at their doors. American Telephone and Telegraph now insists that its stock price hit certain thresholds before exec utives can cash in the bulk of their last option grant. Itel and Becton Dickinson granted options that only pay off if their stocks outperform Treasury bills or the stock market.</p><p>But Mr. Crystal's views are far from being endorsed by other compensation experts, who say there are valid explanations for high compensation levels.</p><p>"The average worker is being eliminated in many ways by improving efficiency and automation. They are a dime a dozen," said Jude Rich, chairman of Sibson & Company, a consulting firm in Princeton. "What we really need is leadership and the good leaders are really scarce."</p><p>And some academics quibble with Mr. Crystal's rigor, particularly his use of a statistical tool known as regression analysis. "His methodology and accusations are leveled at those who are highly paid, but not necessarily those who are overpaid," said Kevin J. Murphy, a professor at the Harvard Business School.</p><p>Professor Murphy argues that of the $9.4 million in 1991 pay for Mr. Anders at General Dynamics, $3 million was based on a sharp spike in the company's stock price, which reflected Wall Street's conclusion that Mr. Anders and his team are doing right by shareholders. Activist Shareholders</p><p>Mr. Crystal has made his mark with a personal computer and the public records of 550 corporations. Because he is so quotable, and willing to be quoted, his ideas have found a wide audience, especially with some of the state pension funds which have begun to take an active role in companies whose shares they own.</p><p>Some of these investors are now quietly calling on big companies like International Business Machines before their shareholder meetings to urge cuts in pay for their key executives or injections of more risk into the packages so that top management's fortunes rise -- and fall -- in line with those of the shareholders.</p><p>Politicians, who see executive pay as a populist issue in an election year, are on the case.</p><p>"The issue he's highlighting is one that concerns most Americans," said Representative Martin O. Sabo, Democrat of Minnesota, another proponent of reform.</p><p>He and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the Democratic Presidential candidate, are looking at ways to use the tax code to curb excessive pay by making it more expensive for the company or for the executives. Of all the proposals being floated, corporations like this idea the least, arguing that it smacks of government interference and ultimately would only harm shareholders by reducing earnings.</p><p>"Whatever happened to the spirit of Horatio Alger?" said Ms. Wachner of Warnaco. "Isn't the hope of every red-blooded girl and boy that they can grow up and run something? I grew up and was able to take over the company I worked for 20 years ago. What's wrong with that?"</p><p>Senator Levin's three-pronged proposal is considered somewhat more acceptable because it is more mild. It would force companies to improve the quality of information made available in their annual proxy statements and would require companies to do a better job of accounting for stock options than they do now. He also favors giving shareholders the right to cast a vote on executive pay, albeit a nonbinding vote.</p><p>There are also some common-sense suggestions being bandied about, aimed at keeping government out of the picture. Aside from replacing stock grants with options, and tying option payouts to a significant rise in the stock price, some suggest that corporate directors hire their own compensation consultants instead of relying on the recommendations of the chief executive's expert.</p><p>Even the Bush Administration has gotten in on the act on the grounds that outsized paychecks not only stain America's image but also hurt the country's ability to compete abroad. Though he has yet to propose anything concrete, Vice president Dan Quayle has joined the chorus of critics, an effort, some say, to blunt the criticism of President Bush's trip to Japan with the corporate executives.</p><p>The Japanese bristled at the compensation for the American executives. The $3.4 million average is not only six times what similar Japanese executives earn, despite a higher maximum tax in Japan, it is also 188 times what the average American worker makes. When Performance Falls</p><p>The ones that often seems utterly baffled by the fuss are the C.E.O.'s. "It is a fact that musicians and ball players and actors make more money than executives," said Edmund T. Pratt Jr., chairman of Pfizer, the pharmaceuticals company, and a member of the General Motors board. "Whether that's more of a contribution than someone running G.M. is certainly subject to question."</p><p>What the executives don't mention, but Mr. Crystal does, is that the pay of an athlete or rock star can plunge almost instantly if his or her performance is found wanting. Not so with corporate executives.</p><p>"The easy part of pay for performance is high pay for high performance," said Mr. Crystal. "The hard part is no pay for no performance."</p><p>Mr. Crystal has run statistical tests on executive pay searching for evidence that high pay reflects, say, increased shareholder returns. He contends the relationship between pay and performance would not be much different if corporate compensation directors simply used random numbers as their guides in setting pay levels.</p><p>How did pay scales get so out of whack?</p><p>Mr. Crystal and other critics say that lax accounting rules deserve some blame for promoting the attitude that the granting of stock options is "free" to shareholders because a company's earnings are not reduced.</p><p>Board chairmen are also to blame for naming so many other well-paid executives, with a vested interest in high pay scales, to their compensation committees.</p><p>Companies may not see it that way, but they aggravate the problem when they deliberately set their pay levels above the "going rate," hoping to keep their top talent from being lured away by the competition.</p><p>"It's very big," said Richard Cyert, president emeritus of Carnegie-Mellon and a member of the H.J. Heinz board committee that gave the "big" compensation to Anthony O'Reilly, the Heinz chief. "But there isn't anybody to match Tony. He has some tremendous external opportunities. The arrangement we arrived at was market driven."</p><p>The biggest culprit, however, is the widespread reluctance to cut compensation in lean years, which companies circumvent by layering one incentive plan on another, virtually insuring that something will pay off under any scenario.</p><p>Mr. Crystal began developing his expertise as a compensation analyst at RCA in 1959. He spent the next 28 years alternating between consulting jobs and jobs in industry. At the pinnacle of his career, he was billing $500 an hour. He was sought out by such corporate bigwigs as Charles L. Brown at A.T.&T.;, William S. Paley of CBS and Joseph D. Williams of Warner-Lambert.</p><p>He had an apartment in Trump Plaza in Manhattan and a house in the San Francisco Bay area, and, at various times, vacation homes in South Hampton, L.I., and Maui, Hawaii. At one point he owned three grand pianos, reflecting his passion for music. Any time he got on a plane, there were two seats waiting, one for him and one for his companion -- a computer, which accumulated its own frequent flyer miles under the name of Ramsey Crystal.</p><p>In 1987, at the age of 53, he took early retirement and joined the business school faculty at the University of California in Berkeley. He soon began a newsletter on executive compensation and kept a few of his consulting clients.</p><p>He made the biggest splash as a commentator, writing columns for Fortune and Financial World and, last year, "In Search of Excess," a kiss-and-tell book chock full of zingers about some of the most private moments of some well-known business figures. Some Painful Choices</p><p>His notoriety, however, forced him to make some apparently painful choices. Some long-time clients, like Martin S. Davis of Paramount and Mr. Pratt of Pfizer no longer wanted to have anything to do with him. Other clients, like Michael D. Eisner of Disney, he dropped rather than allow people to attack his motives for criticizing some executives but not others.</p><p>Many C.E.O.'s clearly hope the compensation issue will go away. But Mr. Crystal believes it will not -- and some executives agree with him.</p><p>"Executive pay generally is a minute fraction of total cost," said Michael D. Rose, chairman of Promus Companies, a casino and hotel company, and a board member at three other companies. "But it's symptomatic. At companies where executive pay is out of line, you'll probably find other things where they are not cost conscious. It will be an indication of a not very demanding management and board."</p><p>Mr. Crystal and others argue that competitiveness is a state of mind, achieved one step at a time. "I don't mean to say that if we solve this, the Japanese will suddenly fall over dead," he said, "but every little bit helps. This is one area where we have to look in the mirror, and we can't blame them for it." FROM THE FAST LANE, DOWN TO HIS LAST PIANO</p><p>For Graef S. Crystal, whose friends call him Bud, the price of his convictions about executive compensation has been steep. For one thing, his annual income has plunged from $850,000 or so in his consulting days to about $120,000. Had it not been for some unwise investments in tax shelters, real estate, and wives (he calls himself a "serial monogamist" now wedded to his "fourth and final wife," Sue), he might have squirreled away more of the money he made in the good years to live on now.</p><p>Moreover, being a gadfly can be expensive. He has five telephone lines into his home, a $12,000-a-year computer data bill and an enormous brokerage bill because he must buy at least one share in every company he tracks just to get the documents he wants for his research. (Dealing with the dividend checks, many for as little as two or three cents, is a problem. Banks just don't want to be bothered. These days the Crystals send the stacks of checks to Mrs. Crystal's father "because he's 81 years old and they won't yell at him for cashing a two-cent check," she said.)</p><p>Mr. Crystal's former life style is fading fast. Fortunately, his home in Napa, a $650,000 two-story modern house nestled into a mountaintop near some vineyards, is paid for. Also, there is a red Porsche in the garage, a wine cellar and a luxurious swimming pool that he lovingly calls his "last capitalistic gasp." But other homes -- a Trump Plaza apartment in Manhattan and two vacation houses -- are gone, through sale or divorce settlements, or are on the block. And, he notes, he is "down to my last piano."</p><p>"The money's not important to me anymore," said Mr. Crystal, who is 57 years old. "I have to have a concert grand, a high-powered computer and a good wife. Other than that I can live in a small apartment."</p><p>What counts, he said, is the freedom to express his views with total candor. And to name names. GOOD GUYS, BAD GUYS</p><p>Part of Graef S. Crystal's success in attracting attention for his ideas is his skillful use of executive compensation war stories.</p><p>For example, he is quick to praise Cummins Engine for doing the right thing back in the early 1980's when a complex incentive scheme he had designed unintentionally produced big bonuses where there should have been no bonuses. The executives realized the mistake and did not demand the extra pay.</p><p>He also has kudos for one John S. Reed, the C.E.O. of Citicorp. "His base salary is up there at about $1.2 million, a bit higher than my tastes suggest it should be," said Mr. Crystal. "The nice thing about him is, he hasn't taken bonuses for a few years or long-term incentive grants, and yet he's given bonuses and incentive plans to people underneath him."</p><p>Even more impressive, he said, is Mr. Reed's recent purchase of $2.5 million worth of Citicorp stock with his own money, an investment that is so far under water it won't do well unless Mr. Reed performs mightily.</p><p>But he regrets advising Salomon Brothers in 1987 that it grant its chairman, John H. Gutfreund, a raft of stock options to make up for the lack of a bonus in a year that the company's results were dismal.</p><p>And he says he won't forget an incident nearly two decades ago involving Michael D. Dingman, then chairman of Wheelabrator-Frye, who asked Mr. Crystal to explore starting a bonus plan. Mr. Crystal recommended that Mr. Dingman cut his base pay. When Mr. Dingman reminded Mr. Crystal who was paying for his services as a consultant, Mr. Crystal says he told Mr. Dingman that the last time he looked, it was the company's signature on his checks. The two never spoke again.</p><p>Through a spokesman, Mr. Dingman said he did not recall the incident.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
