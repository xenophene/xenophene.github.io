Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative television commentator and maverick candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination in the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 18, is in the middle of a daylong campaign blitz along the western edge of the state. By late morning the candidate has made his way to Butson's supermarket in Woodsville. Trailed by a ramshackle army of campaign aides and media people, microphone booms raised like halberds, he enters the store in search of votes.</p><p>Halfway down the first aisle he accepts a slice of pizza from a young woman handing out samples. As he begins to munch, photographers and television crews jostle for position in front of him, TV lights blazing and photographic strobes flashing. After a moment, Mr. Buchanan heads down another aisle and buys a ticket for the New Hampshire lottery. Again, photographers and television crews cluster eagerly, as he holds up the ticket and half-eaten slice of pizza.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-first-para--></div><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ln-ctr-top" style="" class="mod-nytimesline mod-line"><!-- Module starts: ln-ctr-top (Line) --><center><div style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc; height:1px; width:350px;"></div></center><!-- Module ends: ln-ctr-top--></div><!-- Area starts: main-center-center --><div id="area-main-center-center" style=""><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ctr-lt-in-top" style="float:left;" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-lt-in-top (AdCpc) -->

These carefully crafted "photographic opportunities," half real and half symbolic, have become the main activity of most candidates' days.</p><p>New Hampshire in primary season becomes the "mother lode of photo ops," as Barry Piatt, a press aide to Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, puts it. In these intricate ritual dances of candidates and news people, the purpose of photographing the campaign can get lost beneath the visual equivalent of empty rhetoric.</p><p>Many people trace the rise of the by-now-infamous photo op to news editors' demands for a steady stream of colorful and simplistic images. Others blame Ronald Reagan's well-oiled 1980 Presidential campaign. "Setting up the situation, photo op, photo op, photo op -- this is a new language that didn't really exist before 1980," says Arthur Grace, a former Newsweek photographer and a veteran of many campaigns. Now, he says, "everyone's taking a page out of Reagan's book."</p><p>While the images that result from these essentially theatrical events invoke cherished and powerful symbols of American public life, they rarely have much esthetic interest or freshness. But they play a central role in shaping public perceptions of the candidates and of the political process as a whole.</p><p>In itself, the fact that photo ops are built around symbols is not bad. Symbols sum up complex and important values, and the campaigns offer voters an opportunity to reaffirm shared beliefs about themselves and the country. But as candidates try to exert tighter control over images and their meanings, the pictures end up being more predictable. What's lost is the sense of the candidates as real people. It is the unexpected, unplanned detail -- what the late French critic Roland Barthes termed the punctum -- that serves as the photograph's badge of authenticity. In photo ops, such details usually appear only by accident.</p><p>In most news photographs, esthetics are necessarily secondary to facts. But occasionally, pictures like Robert Frank's magisterial images of a row of top-hatted politicians in Hoboken or an impassioned orator in Chicago -- both from his classic 1958 book, "The Americans" -- define the nature of politics more clearly than any political-science treatise could. Other images -- whether of Adlai Stevenson with his legs crossed, revealing the hole in his shoe, or of Harry Truman gleefully holding aloft a premature copy of The Chicago Tribune proclaiming Dewey's victory -- have etched themselves into the national memory. While it is possible that an iconic image of this sort may come out of this year's election, the business of campaign photography has largely been reduced to a mechanical exchange of formulaic images with little if any life left in them.</p><p>The underlying strategy of photo ops is the same as that of most ads: pose the candidate (or the product) with symbols of appealing values, in the hope that viewers will equate the two. In beer commercials these values can include the camaraderie symbolized by a welcoming group of guys in a bar, or the sexual abandon implied by a gaggle of bikini-clad cuties. For a Presidential candidate, the values include patriotism -- where there's a candidate, there's sure to be a flag -- as well as physical vigor, compassion and honesty. Photo ops can also be used to send subtle messages about the candidate's class allegiances. When Mr. Buchanan, a rich man by the standards of most Americans, holds up his pizza and lottery ticket, he's not only carrying out a time-honored ritual expected of a serious candidate, but he is also paying homage to the working-class values these objects embody.</p><p>Most photo ops are built around a core of reality, but "there is a line you cross where these supposedly spontaneous events are actually totally staged," says Steve Liss, who recently photographed Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas for Time magazine. He notes that when President Bush, on a recent trip through New Hampshire, stopped to greet a farmer standing in his field with a cow, the event was presented by campaign aides as unplanned. Later, the farmer was identified as a co-chairman of the local Bush campaign committee. "You could be taken for an idiot if you played into this kind of thing," Mr. Liss says. "And a lot of media people do."</p><p>Factories are always popular campaign stops, but given the parlous state of New Hampshire's economy, they've become especially prominent this year as sites for photo ops. The other day, both Mr. Buchanan and Governor Clinton visited factories, but each tried to give a different slant to the symbolism involved. Mr. Buchanan, to underscore his contention that American jobs are being lost to foreign competitors, spoke outside an abandoned factory in North Haverhill. Governor Clinton, in a more positive vein, toured the American Brush Company factory in Claremont, where better cooperation between labor and management has helped improve business. Despite the different messages the candidates were trying to put across, the resulting photographs showed simply two more factory visits -- and the limits on the kinds of information that photo ops can convey. Complex points of policy do not translate well into photographs.</p><p>Children, too, are naturals on the photo op circuit, and candidates make it a point to be photographed with them. Thus, an earlier stop in Mr. Buchanan's whirlwind tour of Woodsville was at the local elementary school, where he fielded questions from third-graders.</p><p>Occasionally, photo ops get out of hand, and residents balk at taking part. The week before Mr. Buchanan's visit, Vice President Dan Quayle had also dropped in at Woodsville Elementary, and in shoving for position around him the photographers had knocked over some children. As a result, the principal was reluctant to let the media in to record Mr. Buchanan's visit. But campaign aides promised that the press would be on its best behavior, and the photo op went on.</p><p>Candidates often find themselves scrapping over the same potent symbols. That evening in Manchester, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who has made much of his service in Vietnam, was scheduled to appear at V.F.W. Post 79. The small, smoky hall, filled with weathered men in flannel shirts and women in bowling jackets, would seem to be the perfect place to make a pitch for patriotism and working-class values. But when the Senator, a Democrat, and his staff arrived, they found that they had been upstaged. Representative Robert C. Dornan of California, himself a Vietnam vet, had been stumping the state for President Bush and had dropped in on the same post half an hour earlier. A number of the television crews and print reporters there to cover Senator Kerrey's visit wound up interviewing Mr. Dornan instead. In the end, the images of the two men were much the same, with such subtleties as party differences conveyed only in picture captions.</p><p>Often, the message conveyed by a photo op is only peripherally related to the stated issues of the campaign. A photograph distributed by the Associated Press on Jan. 21 recorded a photo op in which former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts appeared at a pond in Concord to announce support from various environmental groups. The photograph, which was printed the next day by The Manchester Union Leader, showed the sweater-clad Senator about to throw a football. The Union Leader didn't even mention the ostensible purpose of the event, thus gutting the occasion of any but symbolic content. But the photograph did demonstrate that Senator Tsongas was a regular guy, especially coming as it did just after the Super Bowl. In a less obvious way, it also offered evidence of the candidate's good health -- which some might see as an issue, given his successful fight against cancer nearly a decade ago.</p><p>Staged photographs can backfire. Earlier in the campaign, Governor Clinton appeared at a bowling alley in the kind of photo op no doubt intended to demonstrate that he, too, has the common touch. But when the tabloid Star ran a picture taken there, along with an article alleging that the singer Gennifer Flowers had had an affair with the Governor, the picture took on very different connotations. It showed Governor Clinton putting on a pair of bowling shoes, but The Star ran it next to a photograph of Ms. Flowers lolling on a bed. Because of the juxtaposition, the Governor appeared to be sitting on the edge of the bed, looking over his shoulder toward Ms. Flowers. Elsewhere, The Star paired photographs taken at different times and places of Governor Clinton and Ms. Flowers on the telephone, suggesting through the layout that they might have been talking to each other.</p><p>Fed up with photo ops, some photographers try to find fresh ways to reveal the workings of the campaign and the personalities of the candidates. In the 1988 campaign, Arthur Grace photographed the candidates for Newsweek in black and white, using a Rolleiflex camera rather than the 35-millimeter cameras standard among photojournalists today. "It was a tremendous discipline," he reports. Because the Rolleiflex allows only 12 shots per roll and does not have interchangeable lenses, Mr. Grace says, "it forces you to think about what you're doing."</p><p>Whereas most campaign photographs are tightly cropped and simplistically composed, Mr. Grace's pictures have a refreshing looseness. They often catch candidates off guard or show the machinery of the photo op, as well as the central symbolic event. Some of his portraits were used in the magazine during the primary season, and more than 20 appeared in a special issue about the election. A year later, the portraits were published by the University Press of New England in the book "Choose Me: Portraits of a Presidential Race."</p><p>Mark Peterson, a 36-year-old photographer for the JB picture agency in New York, who has been following Governor Clinton in this campaign, says that he often finds the audiences more revealing than the candidates themselves. "At this point, the candidates are so polished," he says, "that the most interesting thing to photograph is the people who come to the rallies." He used this approach in covering David Duke in his campaign for the Louisiana governorship. "Sometimes you could capture the anger on their faces," Mr. Peterson says, "better than you'd ever get it from looking at him."</p><p>Steven Rubin has turned away from photographing the candidates altogether. For several months, Mr. Rubin, a 35-year-old freelancer from New York, has been photographing families, unemployment lines, soup kitchens and other situations that, to him, reflect the issues of the campaign. He says that he turned to his new direction because of his dissatisfaction with photo ops. "I found it boring and wearing to be chasing the candidates all the time," Mr. Rubin says. "And in the end your picture is different only because you're standing two inches to the left of the next photographer."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-contributor" style="" class="mod-nytimescontributor"><!-- Module starts: contributor (Contributor) -->Charles Hagen is a critic who writes frequently about photography and art.<!-- Module ends: contributor--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
