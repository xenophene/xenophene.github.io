Bill Clinton, battling to prove the endurance of a candidacy that began with great hopes, and former Senator Paul E. Tsongas, almost tearfully thanking his supporters for carrying him farther than he was ever expected to go.</p><p>Mr. Clinton campaigned with passion and seeming abandon, hoping that his campaign had now bottomed out after the furor over his draft history and was on the upswing.</p><p>"I want these people to see me out there working hard, reaching out to them and fighting until the last dog dies," the Arkansas Governor said today as he and his wife, Hillary, stalked the voters of Manchester, cornering every passer-by, greeting every child.</p><p>"I'm going to go out there and keep trying to cut through to the people, to tell them that I have the best message, the best record, and the best chance to change their lives," he said.

"I'm so grateful," the former Massachusetts Senator said. "Without you, there would be no campaign, no credibility. I hope you feel what I feel about you."</p><p>Sounding almost awed by the status he has achieved by moving past Mr. Clinton in the New Hampshire polls, Mr. Tsongas chanted, "Three more days, three more days."</p><p>The emotional pitch of the Democratic race had its counterpart on the Republican side today as President Bush, in his most direct assault yet on his challenger, Patrick J. Buchanan, accused the conservative commentator of distorting Mr. Bush's record.</p><p>The polls this weekend show Mr. Tsongas at the head of the Democratic pack, followed by Mr. Clinton, with Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa and Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska neck and neck for third place.</p><p>The Kerrey campaign has all but conceded the top spot in the New Hampshire race and is hoping to emerge from the state with enough support to go to the primaries in the West. Speaking today in Concord, Mr. Kerrey seemed relaxed and insisted he was confident of moving on.</p><p>"I look forward to debating Paul Tsongas in South Dakota," Mr. Kerrey said, referring to the Feb. 25 primary there. "It will be a much different debate." Sticking to the Issues</p><p>As with many New Hampshire primaries, political fortunes have shifted time and again in these final days. And no one is making hard predictions about the outcome after a nationally televised debate on Sunday night, an event that is expected to be a rough collision of candidates going for broke. Among the many variables is the strength of the write-in vote for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York.</p><p>This is, in short, a classic New Hampshire primary, in which about 125,000 Democrats in this quirky, atypical state -- 98 percent white, ranked 40th in population -- test and torment a handful of candidates and define their party's Presidential future.</p><p>Whatever else comes out of this primary, the voters have set the framework for the national debate, forcing the candidates to produce an array of economic plans and to stick to the bread-and-butter issues that seemed lost in the 1988 Presidential campaign. Many of the voters here seem dazed by how quickly their boom of the 1980's turned to bust.</p><p>Marie Mullikin, a Derry resident who became a symbol of economic distress when she presented Mr. Harkin with a fat sheaf of home-foreclosure notices in her community, said in an interview this weekend: "This is going on all over the country, and the President says there is nothing wrong. Mr. President, there is."</p><p>All the candidates were closing with economic appeals. Mr. Kerrey's television commercials said he was running for President because "the dream of prosperity for the middle class has been shattered." And Mr. Harkin, who has escalated his attacks on his rivals in recent days, was denouncing his opponents for backing special "fast track" authority for President Bush to negotiate a free-trade agreement with Mexico.</p><p>Mr. Harkin, who is campaigning as the voice of traditional Democratic values and is hustling to make the cut here as a major contender, used as his backdrop today a rubber and tire plant where workers were notified this week that the factory would close within a year and more than 200 jobs would be transferred to Mexico.</p><p>Mr. Tsongas said at his rally in Manchester that his campaign was also about "jobs, jobs, jobs," although his economic proposals are far different from Mr. Harkin's -- including a cut in the tax on capital gains to encourage investment. And Mr. Clinton was touting his record in Arkansas "for better jobs and better education." Sparks at the Finish</p><p>Veterans of Presidential campaigns have long predicted that once the 1992 race got started, it would be a rocket sled ride, and on this, at least, they were right. No one has had a wilder ride than Mr. Clinton, who has turned these final days into a quest for political redemption. He had shot to the top of the polls here as the man with a plan for economic renewal and a keen sensitivity to the grievances of the middle class. Then came the allegation from a supermarket tabloid that he conducted a 12-year affair with a singer, and the tempest over whether he sought to avoid the draft in 1969.</p><p>For all his denials, Mr. Clinton was transformed from the man with a plan to the man with a past. All the character testing and background checking that played out over months for the candidates of 1988 has been compressed, for Mr. Clinton, to a few harrowing weeks. "Had it been any other candidate, he would have been out of the race," George Bruno, one of the Governor's New Hampshire advisers and a former state Demoratic chairman, said this weekend. "But he keeps coming back; he's very up."</p><p>Mr. Clinton is racing around the state, trying to undo the damage; the man who worried about the effect of his draft record on his "political viability" at the age of 23 is not about to let go now.</p><p>"Now I feel like we're back to where we started in this campaign," he said this weekend, straight into the camera, in a 30-minute call-in program that is part of his strategy to reach over the news media and talk directly to the voters. "Me, the people of New Hampshire, and the issues."</p><p>One of Mr. Clinton's new television commercials asserts, "He's been tested in ways the other candidates haven't," and urges, "Take another look."</p><p>Mr. Clinton asserted today that despite the draft issue his support in the South would hold firm; a round of primaries will be held there on March 3 and 10. "I feel very comfortable about where we will be when the dust clears," he said.</p><p>He shied from predictions about Sunday's debate. "Based on what's happening this week," he said with a resigned smile, "I've learned not to anticipate anything."</p><p>Equally intense are the men and women around Mr. Clinton, young Democrats who came to believe much of their early, glowing press and can smell the White House after 12 years in the political wilderness. To the Governor's allies, his careful politics -- the straddling between left and right, the attempt to reach out to the middle class and make a new Democratic case for a more active Federal Government -- represents a last, best hope for a return to power.</p><p>By this weekend, many analysts were saying that Mr. Clinton had staunched his political bleeding, although Mr. Tsongas retained his lead in the local polls. "Clinton has asked for a second chance," said Gerry Chervinsky, a poll taker who conducts nightly surveys for the Boston Globe and WBZ-TV in Boston. "And as I sit here today, I can't say it's over yet." Ranking in the Polls</p><p>In a poll published today in The Globe, conducted Thursday and Friday, Mr. Tsongas was at 32 percent, Mr. Clinton at 25 percent; Mr. Harkin and Mr. Kerrey at 11 percent each and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California at 5 percent. The poll was based on a sample of 400 people considered likely to vote in the Democratic primary on Tuesday and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points.</p><p>Polls released tonight suggested, however, that Mr. Clinton's support had begun to fall again. Still, polling in New Hampshire is mercurial, and Sunday night's debate is expected to have an enormous impact on the race.</p><p>Frank Greer, Mr. Clinton's media consultant, argues that the Governor is in the race for the long haul. "If we finish second or third, this is a campaign that has the message, the strategy, the resources, and the organization on the ground that means we will still win the nomination. We are the only campaign that can say that."</p><p>While the sleek, well-financed front-runner stumbled, the spotlight turned to the quintessential dark horse. Mr. Tsongas entered this race back in April as a regional favorite, and many expected him to fade as the contest developed. Instead, he has become a safe harbor for many voters, a reflection, in part, of the other candidates' difficulties in making a case.</p><p>Mr. Tsongas has carved out a niche as the economic truthteller of the party; he is not running to be Santa Claus, he says, to hand out tax cuts to the middle class, which most of his rivals propose. Economic recovery will be hard, he says, and in this state, dotted with foreclosure signs and closed shops, where nearly everyone has been touched by recession, there is a rough credibility to that message.</p><p>Still, some analysts say Mr. Tsongas is not fully capitalizing on his moment to present himself as a potential President, whose campaign can transcend his region -- a question that is widely asked in the party outside New Hampshire. He has stuck to a remarkably light schedule in recent days, which Mr. Chervinsky described as "a big mistake" and a missed opportunity to "close the sale."</p><p>Today, Mr. Tsongas talked with high emotion to his supporters, who have worked this state for months. He talked of the purpose that drove his campaign, the commitment to the economic measures essential for the next generation. Rather than think of "November, November, November," he said, his campaign was following "a vision to govern."</p><p>Mr. Kerrey has remained philosophical despite polls that show him lagging. "I'd like you to know that I'm not at all, and in fact it's my nature not to get, discouraged," he said at a dinner Friday night. "I understand that the good people of New Hampshire wait quite a long time to make up their minds. They decide at the last minute. Sometimes they decide and change, decide and change, a little bit like Governor Cuomo of New York."</p><p>And Mr. Harkin kept battling to the end -- and defended his strategy of hard-hitting attacks on his opponents. "I'm campaigning hard on my record," he said, "on my vision and program to get America back to work again. If that's tough, well, I'm sorry. It's a tough world out there."</p><p>All of this is playing out in a small state that has become a theme park for elections, where every snow-covered hill and town hall becomes a potential backdrop for the television cameras. Call it Primaryville -- a place that exists until Wednesday.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
