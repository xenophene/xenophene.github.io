Tsongas.</p><p>Mr. Tsongas, a former Senator and Representative from Massachusetts, runs a dogged, bottom-up campaign that works voter to voter, town to town, and captures space in the news seemingly newspaper by newspaper and sound bite by sound bite.</p><p>His is a Spartan campaign with a hair-shirt message: America must wake up to its economic peril or slide into a third-world posture of chronic unemployment and lowered living standards. His solution: an economic pragmatism, mixed with patriotism, sacrifice and responsibility, intended to recapture America's manufacturing pre-eminence.</p><p>This is not a message geared to win the hearts and minds of voters who ditched the Democrats and Jimmy Carter's "malaise" for Ronald Reagan's "Morning in America" and George Bush's "No new taxes."</p><p>But given the economic downturn, a certain disillusionment with shop-till-you-drop materialism, and a natural American altruism that has not been tapped in several elections, it could be a stirring message.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-first-para--></div><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ln-ctr-top" style="" class="mod-nytimesline mod-line"><!-- Module starts: ln-ctr-top (Line) --><center><div style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc; height:1px; width:350px;"></div></center><!-- Module ends: ln-ctr-top--></div><!-- Area starts: main-center-center --><div id="area-main-center-center" style=""><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ctr-lt-in-top" style="float:left;" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-lt-in-top (AdCpc) -->

Whether he is speaking to a group of international executives in Washington or unemployed blue-collar workers in New Hampshire, Mr. Tsongas delivers his message of economic bootstrapping not with the bravado of a candidate intent on victory but with soporific sincerity. The 50-year-old Mr. Tsongas can occasionally be peevish in his presentations, warning his listeners that if they reject him and his message, "I'll go home to Lowell, make money and take care of my family."</p><p>Then there is the cancer that led Mr. Tsongas to retire from the Senate in 1984. Though he has overcome the disease -- he consulted with his doctors before announcing his Presidential campaign -- its specter rises each time Mr. Tsongas looks the least bit tired.</p><p>Mr. Tsongas is also a Greek-American Democrat from Massachusetts, which leads to unflattering comparisons to Michael S. Dukakis, another Greek-American from Massachusetts, who in 1988 failed to wrest the White House from Republicans.</p><p>Some political analysts think that what Mr. Tsongas really wants more than the party's nomination is the opportunity to influence the political debate and help to define the party's platform.</p><p>"He might provide the message for some other messenger," said Robert Squier, a Democratic consultant who is not advising any of this election year's contenders. "That's not fair but that's politics.</p><p>"Voters get down to does this person act, sound, look like a president?" he added. "His problem is he doesn't." Tough Odds Swimming Against the Tide</p><p>What political professionals see as liabilities, Mr. Tsongas tries to present as assets. He is the dark horse that no one has ever taken seriously, the man who beat cancer and the odds in his political races.</p><p>It is the tack taken in his television advertisement in New Hampshire. Called "Swim," it is a 30-second spot of Mr. Tsongas doing the strenuous butterfly stroke the length of a pool while a narrator talks about his history of surprising the political oddsmakers and overcoming cancer, and ends with "Paul Tsongas has never been afraid to swim against the current."</p><p>Mr. Tsongas makes the advertisement itself a kind of courageous march against the odds.</p><p>"The nuclear weapon in this business is 30-second TV ads, O.K.?" he told an audience of teachers at the National Education Association in Washington in early December. "Now, we've already run our first ad. The ad which we've run in New Hampshire, which is the first primary state where we're putting a lot of effort in, is an ad of me swimming the butterfly. Very intellectual. I wanted to demonstrate courage. And I am 50 years old. And I was photographed in a Speedo bathing suit. I challenge you to do the same thing."</p><p>For seven months, he was the lone Democrat to challenge Mr. Bush, a straw in the wind of the President's overwhelming popularity in the wake of the Persian Gulf war. "Spring and summer was like going through a swamp," he said. Now he jokingly tells audiences his candidacy is responsible for the decline in Mr. Bush's ratings.</p><p>"He started out at 91 percent and now he's at 69. Not bad, huh?" he asked a group of unemployed workers, some of whom were studying for General Equivalency Diplomas they hoped would lead to jobs, at an adult learning center here. Not belly-laugh funny, but it elicits chuckles from audiences.</p><p>The party analysts do not openly ridicule Mr. Tsongas's campaign, but neither is he considered a serious contender.</p><p>"Paul Tsongas is a good guy who was an effective Senator who has absolutely no chance of winning," says Ted Van Dyk, a Democratic consultant, in a comment typical of those heard inside the Washington Beltway.</p><p>But Mr. Tsongas said he is not intimidated by the other Democratic contenders and conceded stature only to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York. Without Mr. Cuomo, "we don't have any 1,000-pound gorillas" in the contest, Mr. Tsongas said.</p><p>Mr. Tsongas argues that the Democratic Party has an inferiority complex that prevents it from seeing that it can recapture the Presidency with the economic issue. And on that issue, Mr. Tsongas maintains, it is answers, not pretty-boy looks and scintillating rhetoric, that voters want. Tough Message Giving Priority To the Economy</p><p>In New Hampshire, which has been hard-hit economically, Mr. Tsongas frequently emphasizes how far removed the Republicans are from the lives of ordinary Americans. He tells audiences there that the only unemployed person from New Hampshire that President Bush knows is John H. Sununu. It gets appreciative applause.</p><p>And though Democrats -- and now Republicans -- talk about America's economic woes, Mr. Tsongas notes that he began developing his ideas on the economy over a decade ago, starting in a 1980 speech in which he said that the Democratic Party was out of touch with a changing economic world.</p><p>For the campaign, he has honed this argument into an 85-page booklet, "A Call to Economic Arms," that trounces both parties for allegiance to partisan politics and ideologies that he maintains have sapped the country.</p><p>His solution is pro-business, but he touts his liberalism on social issues, citing his experience as a teacher for the Peace Corp in Ethiopia. He favors abortion rights, civil rights and gay rights. But first and foremost comes the economy. Without a vibrant economy, Mr. Tsongas says, the social services the Democrats have brought to the country cannot be maintained.</p><p>"No goose, no golden eggs," he told his audiences, noting that he serves on a dozen corporate boards and knows the business arena firsthand.</p><p>He wants the country to embark on an industrial policy that would rejuvenate industry from the ground up. He would encourage American technological progress with governmental investment in specific emerging technologies, better funding for science and research at the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, NASA, and the Departments of Energy and Agriculture. He contends that many German and Japanese industries captured markets from their American competitors because of support by their governments. Currently, most Federal research and development money goes to weapons development.</p><p>Mr. Tsongas would also change antitrust laws so that American companies no longer face barriers to joint ventures in research and development and marketing that now hinder their competing in the international market. He wants to reduce the capital gains tax for investments in certain securities held over long periods. He would also provide a tax credit to companies that do research and development.</p><p>Mr. Tsongas is opposed to the middle-class tax cut favored by other Democratic candidates, which he argues will be so small that it will neither benefit consumers nor solve the root problems in the economy.</p><p>When it comes to these issues, Mr. Tsongas is unapologetically tedious. The campaign has printed 100,000 copies of his economic booklet and Mr. Tsongas dispenses them at campaign stops like other candidates distribute buttons. And he expects his audiences to read that booklet.</p><p>"There will be a test afterwards," he quipped, as the small gray books were being distributed to an audience at Plymouth State Community College in Plymouth, N.H. He then went on to batter the audience with his call for a national economic policy as he fiddled with the lectern's microphones and drew charts and graphs on a large flip chart.</p><p>"I need to make people understand that this is a long tough haul," he said. "I've dropped a pebble -- maybe it's the wrong pebble -- but over time, people will talk about it. It is not unlike having cancer. You accept what's there. You deal with it. At some point there is generational responsibility, there is generational morality." Tough Campaign Trading Slogans For Sincerity</p><p>Mr. Tsongas's campaign manager, Dennis Kanin, a veteran of many Democratic races, said his candidate's unorthodox strategy is based on Mr. Tsongas's belief that Americans are fed up with slickness, shaped campaigns and sound-bite sloganeering. "Paul has his own style and people find him genuine. People know Paul's not talking rhetoric, not making statements based on polling data," he said.</p><p>So far, Mr. Tsongas has focused his anti-glitz crusade on New Hampshire, with frequent sorties into Maryland, Florida, Washington state, and other states that hold early primaries or caucuses. He has 42 full-time paid campaign workers and he has been relying on a number of Boston-based advisers for advice, including Lester Thurow, the economist; Daniel Yergin, oil historian and president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates; Kelly McClintock, executive director of the Conservation Law Foundation on environmental issues, and Al Carnaschale at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government and Ruth Morganthau at Brandeis University on foreign policy.</p><p>Mr. Tsongas's fund raising has been slowed by his seven-year absence from Congress and his low name recognition outside New England. He has managed to raise just over $1 million in campaign contributions through a combination of events, direct mail and one-on-one phone calls by Mr. Tsongas. Mr. Tsongas's fund-raising events are decidely downscale.</p><p>"We've had a lot of low-ticket events, in the $10 and $25 range," Mr. Kanin said. "Most of the high-ticket events have been in the $250-$500 range. Often we'll have a two-tier event, say, a $250 dinner and a $100-a-person reception and rally. Everybody has to rely more on organizational support because funds are much tighter than they were."</p><p>A good portion of the money has been spent on travel. Since his announcement in April, Mr. Tsongas has traveled to 30 states. In addition, nearly $100,000 was spent on Mr. Tsongas's television campaign advertisement that aired for two weeks in New Hampshire.</p><p>Mr. Tsongas thinks he will fare well in New Hampshire -- and he is considered by many political organizers to be the candidate to beat here -- not because he is from a neighboring state but because of his message of economic renewal.</p><p>"When the poll was done in New Hampshire in September, I had a lead, the others had not yet made any moves, and so the collective wisdom was that this was a sort of local favorite, but that it would dissipate," said Mr. Tsongas. "That lead is still there and something has to account for that. I'd say my message is getting through. What I generally hear back from people is that what I say makes sense.</p><p>"My strategy has always been to be the last person standing and to try to end up as the person who can steer the country away from economic disaster," said Mr. Tsongas.</p><p>"As long as people can believe that this is a temporary economic setback, that life is a beer commercial, a candidate like me has no relevance," he said. "But my message truly resonates in the business community because they're really scared. That I'm not a dominant orator is irrelevant because they want to get out of this dilemma.</p><p>"But there will come a point of scrutiny on specifics and that's the point where I'll shine. The media finds the economic downturn uncomfortable and inconvenient, so they're far more likely to be attracted to people who do better on television."</p><p>"You take something as simple as the capital gains tax issue," he added, underlining his status as the only Democrat who agrees even in part with Mr. Bush on this issue. "The other candidates have been out for months and yet who knows where they stand? What exactly is the blueprint the other candidates have to bring back the economy? We're going to do something to force the issue, make the other candidates respond. One thing I've done during the campaign is I still attend board meetings, partly for the income but also to keep myself in that mindset. Because on those boards they see what's coming. And at some point, when the nation sees that, they're going to want to know someone who can fly and that's me.</p><p>"I'm fully aware of all the disadvantages I bring," Mr. Tsongas said. "But because of the circumstances of my life, and the last seven years, I feel I'm prepared for that challenge.</p><p>"I know I'm the best candidate. Now if I could just convince God to make me a movie star."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
