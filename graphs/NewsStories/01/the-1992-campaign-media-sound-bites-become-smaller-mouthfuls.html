But it may not have been the best metaphor. Cancer tumors are invidious because they keep growing. Sound bites seem only to shrink.</p><p>In 1968, which was about when television producers began using the term "sound bite," a Presidential candidate spoke for 43 uninterrupted seconds in the average appearance on the evening news. With each subsequent campaign the bites got shorter, and by 1988 the average was a mere 9 seconds.</p><p>If that decline -- 34 seconds in two decades, or 1.7 seconds per year -- were to continue at a linear rate, the average sound bite in 1992 would be 2 seconds long, perhaps something along the lines of "Me President, you voter." A more conservative extrapolation would be in the range of 6.5 to 8.5 seconds, which could be enough for a complete clause.

In fact, there has been so much criticism of sound-bite news, and so many network promises of reform this year, that already a revisionist school is arising to defend the beleaguered bites.</p><p>The debate was set off by two independent studies since the 1988 election. Kiku Adatto, a sociologist at Harvard University, and Daniel C. Hallin, a political scientist at the University of California at San Diego, each showed that sound bites of Presidential candidates on the network evening news had shrunk by more than 75 percent from 1968 to 1988. The data were based on samples of broadcasts in September and October of each campaign.</p><p>There are several reasons for the shrinking bites. The replacement of film with videotape makes it easier to chop up speeches in time for the news. Reporters are encouraged to substitute their own analysis for candidates' oratory. Producers in search of higher ratings insist on shorter, faster-moving pieces -- not always a bad idea, said Dr. Hallin, who was not impressed with some of the leisurely sound bites in the old days.</p><p>"It is hard to see what viewers gained by hearing Richard Nixon ramble in 1968 for 43 seconds about his Aunt Olive," Dr. Hallin said. "But often it was extremely interesting -- or so it seems to me, with 20 years' hindsight -- to hear a politician, or occasionally a community leader or ordinary voter, utter an entire paragraph. One gained an understanding of the person's character and the logic of his or her argument that a 10-second sound bite could never provide."</p><p>The statistics on shrinkage have prompted a glut of complaints and recommendations from politicians, academics and journalists. "Naturally, nothing of any significance is going to be said in 9.8 seconds," said Walter Cronkite of CBS. Other network executives vowed that the 1992 campaign would be different.</p><p>"All the networks are beating their breasts," said Jeff Greenfield, the media and political analyst at ABC News. "Those sound-bite statistics threw into very bold relief what's happened, and I think there'll be an effort this year to make sure the candidates are heard at greater length."</p><p>Already in this campaign some newscasts have shown candidates speaking for a full minute, which is longer than any of the sound bites in the surveys of the 1988 campaign. Michael Sheehan, a media coach who helped prepare Lloyd Bentsen for the 1988 Vice-Presidential debate with Dan Quayle that produced the memorable "Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy" sound bite, said he wondered how long this trend would last. Some Signs of Guilt</p><p>"We're seeing signs of guilt by the media, but I think it'll be like people who are out of shape and force themselves to go to the health club once a month," Mr. Sheehan said. "Every once in a while the media will force themselves to put something a little longer on the air, but the rest of the time they'll revert to their old ways."</p><p>The conventional wisdom is that the public's attention span is inexorably shrinking in the age of MTV, which forces anyone in search of an audience -- television producers, newspaper reporters, politicians -- to deliver shorter, punchier quotes. The defeat of Michael S. Dukakis, the 1988 Democratic nominee, was attributed partly to the "zap gap," his failure to match lines like "Read my lips: No new taxes," George Bush's declaration at the Republican National Convention that became the campaign's most famous sound bite.</p><p>But Peggy Noonan, who wrote that speech (and who had to fight off an editor's attempt to delete the read-my-lips line), thinks this year's cam paign may be the beginning of a new era for sound bites. She sees a post-modernist sensibility taking shape.</p><p>"Sound bites are less relevant this year than anybody knows yet, because the American people have become so sophisticated in the ways of politics and the media," she said. "When Harold and Mary sit back watching the Democrats debate and one of them says something short and pithy and strong, Harold will not say to Mary, 'What a great leader he'll make.' He'll say, 'What a great sound bite.' They'll be impressed by the candidate's technique, that's all. And that's not enough."</p><p>Others, however, insist that a good, short sound bite never really goes out of style. They point to the continuing appeal of classic sound bites, from "Let there be light" to "Give me liberty or give me death" and "We have nothing to fear but fear itself." If most of today's sound bites do not seem destined for Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, the fault does not lie in their brevity.</p><p>"It's quite possible to state a coherent position in a few seconds," said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. " 'I favor Roe v. Wade' is short and tells a lot more than some of the vacuous long sound bites from 20 years ago. Some of the most important statements of our life are short: 'I love you' and. 'Will you marry me?' The problem with sound bites is that the ones chosen for the news often don't have any substance."</p><p>James Pinkerton, deputy assistant to the President for policy planning, believes it is silly to blame the medium for the message, since the medium has become much more than the three major television networks, ABC, CBS and NBC. "Just at the moment when all the do-gooders and professional tut-tutters are telling us we need to take our longer sound bites like we need to take our medicine or our vegetables, the market came along with a much better solution: freedom of choice," he said. "The invisible media hand has given cable viewers a range of MTV to network news to CNN to C-Span. They sound bites or entire speeches." A C-Span Experience</p><p>Even viewers without cable television have the option of the Mac Neil/Lehrer NewsHour on PBS, which runs longer sound bites and is planning to broadcast five to 10 minutes of each candidate's stump speech in early February. But there is nothing like C-Span, the cable public-affairs channel, which regularly broadcasts the unedited wisdom of all the candidates.</p><p>Recently, for instance, one could watch not only an entire speech by Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and the question-and-answer period afterward, but also the small talk that the candidate made with a few people near the camera as the crowd left the hall. And then a viewer could stay tuned for a 25-minute sound bite from Lenora Fulani, the Presidential candidate for the New Alliance Party.</p><p>In some ways, it was a refreshing change from the nightly news programs, but in other ways it was a reminder of why the nightly news programs evolved. There could be worse fates than modern sound-bite news. There could be the variety of sound-bite cancer that Thomas Jefferson detected in the politics of 1824.</p><p>"Amplification is the vice of modern oratory," Jefferson complained. "It is an insult to an assembly of reasonable men, disgusting and revolting instead of persuading." And he presciently summed up his thought in the next sentence with a wrap-up sound bite that could fit in anyone's newscast today: "Speeches measured by the hour, die by the hour."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
