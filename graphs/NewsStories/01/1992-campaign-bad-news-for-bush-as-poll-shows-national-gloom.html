He is facing a discontented and volatile electorate that on a variety of issues is willing to give the opposition party the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>Seventy-three percent of those polled see the country as being in worse shape today than it was five years ago, a crucial measure of the national mood that has not been this grim since the days of "malaise" under Jimmy Carter when the figure was 63 percent. Giving Democrats a Chance</p><p>The public tends to think a Democratic President would do a better job on improving schools, helping the middle class, assuring national health care and even ending the recession, the poll found.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-first-para--></div><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ln-ctr-top" style="" class="mod-nytimesline mod-line"><!-- Module starts: ln-ctr-top (Line) --><center><div style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc; height:1px; width:350px;"></div></center><!-- Module ends: ln-ctr-top--></div><!-- Area starts: main-center-center --><div id="area-main-center-center" style=""><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ctr-lt-in-top" style="float:left;" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-lt-in-top (AdCpc) -->

In the latest survey, conducted Wednesday through Saturday, 46 percent approved of his conduct of foreign policy, while 46 percent disapproved. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.</p><p>On the eve of his speech, Mr. Bush took an opportunity today to bolster his standing among the religious right. Addressing Christian radio and television station officials, he called for voluntary prayer in schools and cited the teachings of Jesus as the moral force behind the Persian Gulf war. Earlier, he reviewed final drafts of his State of the Union Message and staged a dress rehearsal of it before aides in a White House theater. [ Page A17. ]</p><p>While the poll outlines extraordinary opportunity for the Democrats, it is just that. The survey shows that less than a month before the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 18 only one Democrat, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, has broken from the pack in the race for the Presidential nomination.</p><p>Among those who said they were likely to vote in the Democratic primaries nationwide, Mr. Clinton's support has jumped to 22 percent, from 5 percent in October. The Governor is currently trying to steady his campaign in the face of accusations in a supermarket tabloid that he committed adultery.</p><p>Presidential approval ratings at this stage of a campaign are not a reliable indicator of a President's chances on Election Day. Two recent Presidents had ratings in the Gallup polls similar to Mr. Bush's in January of their re-election year: Gerald R. Ford, who went on to lose, though narrowly, and Richard M. Nixon, who stood at 46 percent approval at the beginning of 1972, and won 49 states that November against George S. McGovern.</p><p>Charles R. Black Jr., a senior adviser to the Bush campaign, said that the Democratic race was "in its embryonic stages" and that any predictions about the strength of the party's eventual nominee were highly premature.</p><p>The economy is clearly driving political attitudes now and profoundly changing the zeitgeist of the 1980's. Seventy-eight percent of those polled say the economy is in bad shape, and only 9 percent say they think it is improving.</p><p>Even with a burdensome Federal deficit, the survey suggests that the public is in the mood for a more active Federal Government engaged in some basic pump-priming. Sixty-five percent said they favored more Federal spending to create jobs; 74 percent favored more spending to improve education, and 74 percent said they would spend more to provide affordable health care to all Americans. Paying for Health Insurance</p><p>The idea of national health insurance has clearly caught fire: 65 percent said they would favor a system financed through taxes. Fifty-three percent said they would be willing to pay $1,000 a year more in Federal taxes to cover it, if that freed them from other medical costs.</p><p>The public voiced a clear preference on the best way to jump start the economy: 59 percent said the Federal Government should spend more and try to create jobs, while 28 percent said that tax cuts were the way to go.</p><p>The public seemed to have only modest expectations about what a tax cut for the middle class could do for the economy. Asked what kind of effect a tax cut of $400 or $500 would have, 11 percent said it would a major effect in ending the recession, 34 percent said small and 49 percent said it would make no difference.</p><p>Still, the middle class -- and 75 percent of those polled said they considered themselves part of it -- feels a clear sense of grievance. When asked who had suffered most from the policies of the Federal Government in the past decade, 46 percent said the poor and 43 percent said the middle class. When asked who had most benefited, 82 percent said the rich. An Edge for Democrats</p><p>Moreover, the Democrats' efforts to cast themselves as the champions of the middle class are paying off. Fifty-nine percent of the respondents said a Democratic President would be more likely to care about the needs of the middle class, while 25 percent said Mr. Bush would.</p><p>That was just part of the edge that the public gives to an idealized Democrat when asked who could do a better job on several issues. Forty-six percent said a Democratic President would be more likely to improve education, as against 31 percent who cited Mr. Bush. Sixty-one percent said a Democratic President would be more likely to make health care available to all, as against 19 percent who cited Mr. Bush.</p><p>Forty-two percent of the respondents said they thought a Democratic President would do a better job dealing with the abortion issue, while 32 percent cited Mr. Bush.</p><p>Perhaps most worrisome to Mr. Bush, 45 percent said a Democratic President would be most likely to end the recession, as against 32 percent who cited the incumbent.</p><p>Mr. Bush was given the edge in two categories in the poll: protecting family values and seeing to it that the United States is respected by other countries.</p><p>The poll shows public attitudes toward Japan changing remarkably fast, reflecting the debate surrounding Mr. Bush's recent trade mission there. The number of Americans who say the Japanese look down on them has risen 24 points in two months, to 67 percent from 43 percent in November.</p><p>A majority of Americans -- 56 percent -- say they favor protecting American industries and jobs by limiting imports, while 38 percent said they backed free trade that would make available good products at low price regardless of where they were made.</p><p>And Mr. Bush's effort to cast his Japanese trip as a mission for jobs clearly backfired. Sixty-three percent said the trip was a failure; 19 percent judged it a success.</p><p>But the results in the current poll were not all bad for Mr. Bush. Seventy-one percent of the public disapproves of the way Congress is doing its job, suggesting that Mr. Bush's Congress-bashing will fall on receptive ears.</p><p>But the overall mood of the public was a striking change from that in the expansive 1980's. It was measured by questions asking people to rate the present state of national affairs on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 the worst and 10 the best. They were asked to do the same for the state of affairs five years ago and five years in the future.</p><p>Over all, the respondents gave an average rating to the present of 4.63, lower than any measure taken by The New York Times/CBS News Poll since it began asking the question in November 1979. Reflecting little optimism, they gave the future a rating of 4.97. But looking back five years, they saw a better time, and gave it a rating of 6.54.</p><p>Looking at the Democratic Presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton was first at 22 percent, followed by former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California at 13 percent, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts at 10 percent, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska at 9 percent and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa at 4 percent.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
