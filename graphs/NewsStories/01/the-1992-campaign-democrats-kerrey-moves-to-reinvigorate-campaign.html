Although Mr. Kerrey's strategists have been careful not to gloat for the record over the rival camp's stumble, they are clearly eager to profit from the fact that the Democratic race once again seems fluid.</p><p>Hailed early by the press as a 48-year-old combination of Sir Lancelot and James Dean, Mr. Kerrey faded through the fall with flat performances, a vague agenda, except for his health insurance plan, and an overreliance on his war record. Faced with a renewed opportunity, Mr. Kerrey's response so far is not to offer the missing details of how he would govern but to try to persuade Democrats that details are a trivial pursuit and that he is not their man unless they want to make a leap of faith. 'You've Got to Fight for It'</p><p>"I am not a bookkeeper," he said, in an interview in Washington last week, referring to Mr. Clinton's promotion of himself as a seasoned manager with an economic plan. "I am not a person who has any desire to come forward and say, 'Here's a cabinet full of smooth-moving drawers.'</p><p>"I'm going to try to drive out the idea that this is just about nominating someone who's electable. You either are or you are not in politics because you want to change the world. I do not, in a very personal way, believe that good all by itself conquers evil. You've got to fight for it."</p><p>Mr. Kerrey is trying to make a virtue of vagueness, arguing that his status as a work in progress, an unfinished politician, could be a strength as President.</p><p>He said he carried with him a book by Albert Schweitzer that explained why it was good not to have all the answers. "Schweitzer says that real learning doesn't occur unless you are in an attitude of humility," Mr. Kerrey said. "And that's extremely difficult as a politician. Shines in Small Settings</p><p>By the standards of modern campaigning, Mr. Kerry can be amiable and witty in small settings. On a trip to Berlin in northern New Hampshire, he charmed hard-boiled reporters by talking excitedly about how his motel bed featured the "Magic Fingers" massage machine and asking an aide to come up and check out the shaking bed.</p><p>Mr. Kerrey was asked what he did for fun outside of politics with a warning that Michael S. Dukakis had answered the question, "Black mulch," speaking of fertilizing his tomato plants. Mr. Kerrey replied with a twinkle: "Black Mulch. I have some of their albums."</p><p>While he affects the sing-song Kennedy cadences in speeches, Mr. Kerrey has not shown the potent charisma of John F. Kennedy, which Democrats seek like the Holy Grail. At one of Mr. Kerrey's appearances a large number of Dartmouth students left a less-than-scintillating session early to go to a screening of "J. F. K."</p><p>Mr. Kerrey often seems more like wry observer than eager candidate. With large blue eyes and a lightbulb-shaped head that give him the look of a bemused extraterrestial, he continues to maintain an unusual Jamesian distance from his campaign.</p><p>Even on an unscheduled stop at an American Legion Post in Manchester last week, surrounded by admiring Vietnam veterans who greeted him as "a brother," Mr. Kerrey did not seem to fit into the scene easily. With a military cap perched on his head and a beer, Mr. Kerrey chatted rather awkwardly with some of the men around the bar. Learning How to Shout</p><p>He asked Bill Genesee, 38 years old, who was describing his job at the Raytheon Corporation making missiles, "When you walk past sheet metal, wouldn't you like to get out and bang it?"</p><p>Stung by criticism that he was too diffident, Mr. Kerrey has been trying to convey urgency by adding a life-and-death message to his speeches and speaking in a louder voice.</p><p>"People would come up and say, 'You just don't seem to want this badly enough, because you're not shouting at us,' " So now I'm given to shouting, and it's not my favorite voice," he said.</p><p>Mr. Kerrey's aides tend to watch him nervously, knowing that he sometimes says things that are more Brecht than boilerplate.</p><p>In response to a question about Sidney Blumenthal's New Republic cover articles on "The Politics of Self: Bob Kerrey's Shallow Campaign" and "The Anointed, Bill Clinton, Party Favorite," Mr. Kerrey laughingly suggested that he would like to "loosen one of his teeth," a move that he told others would wipe away Mr. Blumenthal's "preppy little smile." 'Close to the Edge'</p><p>"He does skate close to the edge," a strategist for Mr. Kerrey, Michael McCurry, said. "But sometimes I think he says things that provoke reactions just to remind himself that he's not a conventional politician, to remind himself, 'If you're not careful, you're going to wind up like Bill Clinton.' "</p><p>Mr. Kerrey's strategists see his problem as how to convince people that he is different but reassure them that he is not too different. People may snicker at Vice President Dan Quayle's reading Paul Johnson's "Modern Times," a history of the 20th century, for three years, according to what he and his aides tell reporters. But it may also make voters nervous when Mr. Kerrey says one of his favorite books is Walker Percy's "Moviegoer," an anthem of alienation about a Korean War veteran out of touch with the rest of America.</p><p>Mr. Kerrey agrees that sometimes his aides are right when they warn him with the "time out" hand signal. "I can keep a little line on the reel," he said. "I don't need to put it all out there."</p><p>Mr. Kerrey presents his character, shaped by war and wounds, as the reason why voters should put faith in his leadership.</p><p>As a candidate, John F. Kennedy let Red Fay and other aides brag about his war record as a fighter, while he discreetly avoided the topic. But Mr. Kerrey still begins speeches with lines like this one to an A.F.L.-C.I.O. meeting in Austin last week: "Let me start off by saying that in spite of the fact that I left a little of myself over in Vietnam, there's a hell of a lot left to be able to drive George Bush and Danforth Quayle out of that White House."</p><p>Mr. Kerrey suggested that some reporters who had criticized him for talking too much about his war record were "feeling this enormous guilt themselves, because they didn't do anything" in the war.</p><p>He said he did not mind that many men in his generation chose to avoid going to war. "It doesn't bother me deeply," he said. "But when there's dishonesty, it does. When Quayle first had his trouble in 1988, I defended him. But when he asserted that he got into the National Guard in order to go to Vietnam, he lost me completely. That was a lie. He didn't get into the Guard in order to get in Vietnam.</p><p>"But what I do object to is now when they come and give this golden reason for why they really wanted to go to Vietnam. Bill Clinton does that a little. I mean, come on, there were a lot of us who didn't want to go to Vietnam."</p><p>In speeches, Mr. Kerrey obliquely scores Mr. Clinton for making "personal responsibility" a campaign theme, implying that his own nine months in a Navy hospital in Philadelphia learning how to walk again imbued him with moral superiority. "I understand the nature of personal responsibility," he tells audiences. "I'm the one, since I was injured, that had to learn how to walk, learn how to run, how to do the things I wanted to do."</p><p>In conversations with friends, he denigrates Mr. Clinton as lacking conscience, complaining that the Governor of Arkansas had made too many political compromises trying to make everyone happy.</p><p>"I have learned the necessity of developing a conscience and of letting that conscience speak to you," Mr. Kerrey said. "The ground for my campaign isn't a position paper or a policy institute. The ground is my conscience."</p><p>Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kerrey had a tiff after Mr. Clinton had made a commercial criticizing Mr. Kerrey for voting for the Congressional pay raise. Mr. Kerrey noted that Mr. Clinton had the perquisites of the Governor's office. Mr. Clinton shot back that Mr. Kerrey, too, had "lived in the Governor's mansion."</p><p>"There were a lot of stories written about it," Mr. Clinton.</p><p>Privately, Mr. Kerrey was furious at Mr. Clinton's apparent reference to his relationship with Debra Winger, the actress. He told people that he was single and free to do as he pleased and that Mr. Clinton had a nerve mentioning it. Decision Not to Date</p><p>Even before reports about an extramarital affair by Mr. Clinton, Mr. Kerrey said he had decided that he could not date during his campaign, even though he had been divorced from his wife, Beverly Defnall, for 14 years. They had been married for four years.</p><p>He said he believed that in a political season when voters quickly sketched in portraits he could not take the risk. "People do not know who Bob Kerrey is, and I don't want them to be reading stories about who it is that I'm dating and trying to figure out who I am," he said.</p><p>Although Mr. Kerrey would like to present himself as the candidate of conscience, the politician who embodies the idealism and skepticism of the 60's and who hates expediency and trade-offs, that message keeps running into sharp questions about own values, business practices and conflicting positions.</p><p>At the St. Paul's Academy in Concord, N.H., Mr. Kerrey received a bristling reception from students who wanted to know how he could emphasize national health insurance when the part-time workers in his restaurant chain did not have health insurance.</p><p>On "Meet the Press" on NBC News Mr. Kerrey delivered a stumbling response on abortion, as he tried to explain that his switch from opponent to proponent. Questions on Death Penalty</p><p>In 1982 Mr. Kerrey said in a letter to Nebraska State Senator Bernice Labedz that he believed "the unborn to be human life and entitled to all the protections the state can legally offer for the preservation of life."</p><p>He added that the "death and destruction of young men that I led in battle" in Vietnam had helped shape his decision.</p><p>But on Saturday, Mr. Kerrey was asked about the death penalty by former Manhattan Borough President Percy E. Sutton, now an executive in Harlem. Mr. Sutton, at a candidates' forum sponsored by the Rainbow Coalition in Washington, asked how Mr. Kerrey could support the death penalty, in light of the fact that he had talked about seeing young men die in Vietnam and that "so many people who are poor are not given the opportunity to have proper representation."</p><p>"Death is final, isn't it?" Mr. Sutton asked Mr. Kerrey in just the sort of question that the candidate of existential angst might have enjoyed in a different setting.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
