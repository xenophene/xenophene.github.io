But they are exploiting the sense that many voters have that Americans are being treated unfairly in international trade, especially by the Japanese.</p><p>In fact, American exports have almost doubled in the last six years, and this country is running neck and neck with Germany for the position of the world's top exporter. Moreover, the most recent New York Times/CBS News Poll on the subject, taken in November, shows that 32 percent of Americans believe that the Japanese compete unfairly, a number significantly lower than the 47 percent who say that Americans tend to blame Japan improperly for the nation's own economic problems.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-first-para--></div><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ln-ctr-top" style="" class="mod-nytimesline mod-line"><!-- Module starts: ln-ctr-top (Line) --><center><div style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc; height:1px; width:350px;"></div></center><!-- Module ends: ln-ctr-top--></div><!-- Area starts: main-center-center --><div id="area-main-center-center" style=""><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ctr-lt-in-top" style="float:left;" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-lt-in-top (AdCpc) -->

After gaining office, every President since Herbert Hoover has taken basically a free-trade stance, although several have said they favored trade restrictions in their campaigns.</p><p>But now, of the main Democratic candidates, only Paul E. Tsongas, the former Massachusetts Senator, is vigorously opposed to new trade restrictions. But his language is as strident as that of the others. "Others just blame the Japanese," he declares in his latest commercial. "Paul Tsongas will beat them, the American way, by making quality come first again."</p><p>Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska make no bones about advocating stiffer trade barriers. "I'm proud to be accused of being a protectionist," Mr. Harkin often says.</p><p>Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas calibrates the problem in a way that lets him strike a middle course. About one-quarter of the problem, he says, is that the Japanese have unfair trade rules; the other three-quarters is that the United States does not work hard enough to "compete and win."</p><p>President Bush, who used sharp words of his own on his trip to Japan this month, purports to be a free-trader. His acid test will come in the spring, when restrictions against imported steel are due to expire just before the primary in Pennsylvania, where steel is a major industry. In 1988, when polls showed him trailing in the state just before the fall election, Mr. Bush advocated continuing those limits.</p><p>Among economists, the mainstream has supported free trade, but it may have wandered slightly. Some prominent experts are now arguing that the United States must change its policies to compete more aggressively with the Japanese and Europeans. One of these is Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., an economist and trade official in the Reagan Administration.</p><p>"They're playing football and we're playing baseball, and we're both playing by the rules," he said in an interview. "But football is a contact sport, a rougher game than baseball, and our guys are getting beat up."</p><p>To follow the issue, it is important to understand not only the politics but also the economic theory, the history of postwar international commerce and the way the United States and its allies now restrict trade. Trade Issue Rouses The Big Losers</p><p>Over the years, no other issue has caused such dissonance between scholars and politicians as trade.</p><p>Since the time of Adam Smith more than two centuries ago, almost every Western economist has been trained that unfettered trade is the best policy. On paper, it is. If you tally all the economic benefits from free trade and all the benefits from protection, free trade generally comes out ahead.</p><p>But politics is fueled by votes, not theories, and it is a rare politician who has not at one time or another sought protection from international competition for constituents. That is because while many people may be helped a small amount by free trade, a few people can be hurt a great deal.</p><p>For example, if a country allows shoes to be imported from abroad, where they can be manufactured more cheaply than at home, almost all consumers will be better off because they will pay a few dollars less for their shoes. But the domestic shoe industry might fold. And the people who own or work for shoe companies could lose their livelihoods.</p><p>Not surprisingly, the big losers, not the small winners, are the people who base their votes on where the candidates stand on shoe imports. So politicians normally abide by what Charles L. Schultze, who was budget director for President Lyndon B. Johnson and chairman of President Jimmy Carter's Council of Economic Advisers, calls the principle of "do no direct harm." Barriers Came Down After World War II</p><p>Whatever the economic and political theory, the United States became an industrial power in the late 19th and early 20th century by using tariffs and Government subsidies to shield its industries from foreign competition. But the bubble burst in the 1930's after the enactment of the infamous Smoot-Hawley law. High American tariffs precipitated retaliatory barriers from Europe. Trade and industry were crippled, the roar was wiped out of the 20's and the world tumbled into Depression.</p><p>Learning from mistakes, the United States and most of its industrial allies, including to some degree Japan, lowered trade barriers bit by bit from the end of World War II until the early 1970's. Then, in the 1970's, after the cartel of petroleum exporting countries caused oil prices to skyrocket, nation after nation began to erect trade walls as their economies contracted.</p><p>Early in the 1980's, largely because of the extraordinarily high value of the dollar, the United States began to run a serious trade deficit for the first time in more than a century. Trade restrictions here exploded. When the dollar is strong, imports are less costly and American exports are more expensive, which meant that important domestic industries like copper, steel and autos found themselves unable to compete.</p><p>The trade deficit peaked in 1987, at $152 billion. Then, the value of the dollar fell. The deficit was only $65 billion last year.</p><p>Exports led the comeback. The politicians rarely mention it, but the market in Japan for American manufactured goods grew faster than any other big market except Mexico, nearly doubling to $31 billion last year from $16 billion in 1987.</p><p>But imports from Japan also expanded, so the United States trade deficit with Japan shrank slowly. It was about $40 billion last year, down from $56 billion in 1987.</p><p>By contrast, the United States has turned around its trade deficit with Europe. Last year, the United States sold about $17 billion more in goods and services to the 12 nations of the European Community than it imported from those countries.</p><p>And American trade barriers have also been relaxed slightly. The share of United States imports subject to some kind of protection rose to 21 percent in 1984 from 8 percent in 1975, according to Gary C. Hufbauer, an economist at the Institute for International Economists. Now, he said, the figure is only 16 percent to 18 percent.</p><p>The World Bank calculates that the European Community restricts a slightly larger proportion of imports than the United States, while Japan protects about one-quarter of its imports. Trading Countries Use Many Types of Protection</p><p>The United States has been the international leader in promoting free trade for more than 50 years. The Reagan and Bush Administrations struck free trade agreements with Canada and Israel, began negotiating a pact with Mexico and led the push for a reduction in trade barriers worldwide.</p><p>But the United States protects some of its own industries, especially agriculture. Ice cream imports, for example, are limited to less than one teaspoon per person each year. Sugar imports are capped at about a quarter of the nation's annual consumption, and grain and tobacco farmers are subsidized. The result is not only to keep out foreign agricultural products but to increase markedly what consumers pay for food.</p><p>Pressure to "Buy American" also seems to be growing. This week, responding to protests, the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission canceled a $122 million rail transit contract with Sumitomo, a Japanese company.</p><p>The United States also restricts foreign investment in its shipping, airline, radio, television and long-distance communications industries.</p><p>In Europe, through a system of import quotas, lavish export subsidies and purchases of extra production, farmers are protected to a much greater extent. This has caused considerable friction in international trade talks. The Europeans view their rules as much as a social policy as an economic one.</p><p>"I've been in your cities," a European agriculture official told an American reporter, "and I don't want our cities to get like that, crowded with all the people who have moved off the farms. We don't have plains and prairies and deserts like you. Our farms are our countryside."</p><p>European governments also often impose rules against buying from foreign suppliers and actively support direct subsidies to favored businesses, a practice generally avoided in the United States. Airbus Industrie was set up with billions of dollars in taxpayer money from Germany, France, Britain and Spain to compete with American aircraft manufacturers.</p><p>In Japan, rice imports are completely banned. Japan agreed in 1988 to cancel rigid limits on imported beef and oranges but replaced them with tariffs of more than 50 percent. "The price of sirloin steak in downtown Tokyo's $26 a pound," Senator Harkin complained in last Sunday's debate of Democratic Presidential candidates. "We could sell it for $4 or $5 a pound over there, but they won't let it in."</p><p>Japan's keiretsu -- loosely knit industrial and banking groups with sprawling interests -- buy mainly from within their group and keep out imports.</p><p>The Japanese Government bureaucracy and professional groups have other ways of blocking foreigners from offering services. Americans complain, for instance, that the dates when contract bids in Japan are due are not announced.</p><p>But some Japanese trade barriers are being lowered slowly. After three years of arm-twisting, Toys "R" Us was permitted last month to open its first store in Japan. The Japanese Government agreed during President Bush's recent visit to buy more large American computers and parts for automobiles. Disagreements On What to Do</p><p>The Japanese argue that their trade advantage over the United States is based on their superior education, training and production, and most American politicians agree that improvement here is needed in those areas. Still, although the American economy is roughly twice as productive as the Japanese, politicians here from both parties find political mileage in harping on what they see as unfair advantages in the Japanese system.</p><p>"The two economies are simply incompatible," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, reflecting a pervasive view in Congress. "They are a society that is intensely focused on production and export, and we are focused on consumption and import."</p><p>But there are significant differences on how best to respond, and no single position is dominant.</p><p>The White House stance is that the United States should use its diplomacy to persuade Japan to change its ways. Mr. Bush's trip to Japan this month was basically a trade mission.</p><p>Many Democrats favor a form of industrial policy in which specific American industries are singled out for Government subsidies so they can become more competitive.</p><p>Beyond the florid oratory in New Hampshire, a consensus may be developing, at least in theory, about what American trade policy should be in the years ahead. Almost everyone agrees that the United States should make better use of what Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat, calls "the juicy allure of American markets" to pry open markets elsewhere.</p><p>In addition, many economists as well as politicians are arguing that the Government should compensate communities, companies and workers damaged by imports, withhold subsidies to unproductive industries and offer some assistance to those that show the promise of being able to win a healthy share of world commerce. But who would decide, and how?</p><p>"I'm very skeptical," said Benjamin M. Friedman, a professor of political economy at Harvard, "that this could ever work in the American system."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
