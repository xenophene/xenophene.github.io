So when America's Big Three automakers met their Japanese counterparts for a breakfast chat in Tokyo, the atmosphere was stormy, to say the least. The Americans were miffed at the vagueness of Japanese buying pledges. Somehow, 20,000 more cars "did not sound like a lot," said an angry Lee A. Iacocca, chairman of the Chrysler Corporation. And who would they buy from, anyway? Detroit or Japanese transplants? They never said. "There is no agreement," said Harold Poling, chairman of the Ford Motor Company, calling the pledges "inadequate." For their part, the Japanese lectured the Americans, telling them to improve the quality of their products and reform their industry. "We haven't done anything wrong," said Yutake Kume, president of Nissan. "We don't need to rectify our conduct or our deeds." The Candidates Slip Away In an election year, when the economy is in a slump, it usually signals trouble for the incumbent. Sure enough, last week's New York Times/CBS News Poll showed President Bush's approval rating slipping to just 48 percent because of the weakness of the economy. But the sluggish economy also seems to be working against the challengers. First, the effects of the slump caused Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York -- the Democratic front-runner -- to renounce his Presidential aspirations and concentrate on New York's economic woes. And last week, Virginia's Governor, L. Douglas Wilder, said he would drop out of the race to work on Virginia's economy. If the economy turned around, would they run? First the Good News In economics, all blessings are mixed. The Labor Department said last week its producer price index, which charts inflation at the producer level, had fallen by 0.2 percent in December. Such a tumble means inflation is virtually licked. "Inflation at the producer level is likely to be about 2 percent or so overall for the year, with consumer prices rising only about 4 percent for the year," said Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities in Chicago. But the reason for the decline in prices "is decreased demand," he said. The Fall-Off's No Fallacy For individuals, its best to pinch pennies in a recession since job prospects are uncertain. But to get the economy going, the country needs people who spend. That is the problem economists call the "fallacy of composition." According to the Federal Reserve, that's what the country is facing now. The Fed reported that consumer credit expanded by a minuscule $27 million in November -- about 25 cents a worker. The reason for the fall-off in borrowing is Detroit. More people are paying off auto loans than taking out new ones. Another Prod for Washington? There was more gloomy news on unemployment last week. According to the Labor Department, 300,000 more people became unemployed in December. That brought the unemployment rate to 7.1 percent, two-tenths of 1 percent higher than the month before. "Seven percent is an important political number," said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Company. "If the Administration isn't galvanized already into acting, this will do it." Such actions could include tax cuts and further drops in the discount rate, he said. Selling Health-Care to Doctors Last week, the White House chief of staff, Samuel K. Skinner, invited a group of doctors to the White House (they still make White House calls) to sound them out on President Bush's plans for fixing the nation's health-care crisis. America spends more than any country on medical care -- 14 percent of gross national product -- yet 34 million Americans have no coverage at all. President Bush wants more than a Band-Aid, Mr. Skinner told the doctors, including Dr. James S. Todd, executive vice president of the American Medical Association. The Administration wants to provide incentives for enrolling in prepaid group plans which buy group care at a discount from providers. It also wants to include tax credits for purchasing medical insurance and, for the doctors, it wants to limit awards in malpractice lawsuits. The doctors seemed pleased. Tax credits alone, said Dr. Todd, won't solve the crisis. Bristol-Myers Squibb said it would reduce its prices to the Government by $80 million.

But lately, the fountains -- and the stores -- haven't been doing so well. The Woolworth Corporation, which operates 6,500 stores in the United States and had sales of $9.8 billion in 1991, said last week it would close or reformat 900 stores that lost about $50 million from January last year through October. About half of the 10,000 employees at those stores would lose their jobs. The closings will lead to a charge of $250 million. A Sand Trap for the Japanese Minoru Isutani, the reclusive Japanese golf entrepreneur, paid $840 million for the Pebble Beach Company and its golf links on the California coast in Monterey. His plan was to sell memberships for as much as $1 million, the way they do in Japan. That would would help him pay off the $450 million he borrowed to buy the resort. But last week the Monterey County supervisors drove his plans into the rough. They rescinded an agreement permitting the sale of memberships guarantying tee times and room reservations at the resort because it would limit the public's access to the course. "Even though it costs about $200 a round, it's the only one of the top three courses the public can play," said Chris Hodenfield, senior editor of Golf Digest magazine. Two hundred dollars? "Its an awe-inspiring course," he said. "There's the spray off the ocean, sea lions on the rocks. Playing it is like opium." More Service in the Skies Last week, American Airlines said it would offer business-class service on its flights between New York and Los Angeles. For an extra $200, you'll get wider seats, better service and meals you can both identify and eat. A Detroit-Style Solution When Detroit's manufacturing moguls touched down in Tokyo last week with President Bush, they arrived complaining about Japan's reluctance to buy American cars and car parts. They had a case when it came to car parts, but cars? Japan drives on the left, after all, and no American manufacturer produces a domestically built right-hand-drive car. Last week, the Ford Motor Company said it would solve that problem, building a right-hand version of its sporty Probe in Flint Rock, Mich. -- in about 20 months. Not only is that an inordinate amount of time to make the changes, but Flint Rock is run by Japan's Mazda Motor Corporation, in which Ford owns a stake. The new Probe should feel at home in Japan. That's where its engine, transmission and drive-train are made. A Surprise Downgrading While Lee A. Iacocco, chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, and Robert Stempel, chairman of the General Motors Corporation, were in Japan trying to drum up business, $100 billion worth of their debt was downgraded. Moody's Investor's Service knocked $75 billion worth of G.M.'s debt to A2 from A1 while Standard & Poor's pushed about $20 billion of Chrysler's debt to B+, from BB-. The downgrading will make it more costly for them to borrow. "We didn't expect it," said Robert Lutz, Chrysler's president. It's back to the drawing boards for the financial planners. Overtrading Paine Webber Inc. was ordered by the New York Stock Echange last week to pay $900,000 in fines for recommending investments to its retail customers that were often too risky and for buying and selling stocks merely to generate fees. In one case, the exchange said, trading was so excessive that $300,000 in commissions was generated in two and half years on five accounts with a combined value of less than $1 million. INTERNATIONAL</p><p>British Rate Rise Likely The snake (the European system of relatively fixed exchange rates) is wrapping itself around Britain, python-style. Since Germany's central bank raised its key interest rates point last month, other European central banks have been forced to follow suit. France made its moves last month. Now the problem is Britain. Its currency is falling against the Spanish peseta. "There is a trend toward high rates in Spain, versus a perception of lower rates in Britain," said Carl Weinberg, chief economist of High Frequency Economics. That suggests British rates may move up. The dollar, meanwhile, is doing just fine, thank you. It's at its highest level in two months. "Technical factors are moving the market," said Madis Senner, of Sunray Securities. "With the mark a high-yield currency,it climbs then viciously corrects," he said.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
