The compressed campaign season leading to the Feb. 18 primary, coupled with a recession that has tripled the number of unemployed New Hampshire residents since 1988, has forced a different approach this year.</p><p>Each candidate must now prove, through radio and television advertisements and in appearances at plant gates and shuttered stores, that he is tough enough to end the bad times.</p><p>Campaign strategists are trying to cut through the economic malaise to appeal to voters like Lou Marchand, who stood alone in her rural Hillsborough restaurant during a nonexistent lunch hour rush one day this week.

She said she and her husband, Ron, strain to pay their monthly $250 health insurance premium and keep their business afloat.</p><p>"It's been pretty tough around here," she said with the New Englander's gift for understatement. More Pragmatic</p><p>To reach people like Mrs. Marchand, who sees little difference among the Presidential hopefuls so far, the candidates have abandoned the customary warm and fuzzy biographical advertisements. Instead, the first spate of television spots, which began appearing here this week, illustrate the new, more pragmatic manner in which the candidates are choosing to make themselves known to voters.</p><p>In Gov. Bill Clinton's 60-second effort, Mr. Clinton is in front of a flag in his Arkansas State House office. Gazing into the camera, he talks about the "forgotten middle class" and his plan to rescue its members.</p><p>In Paul E. Tsongas's commercial, the second he has put on the air in New Hampshire, he boasts of his accomplishments as a United States Senator from Massachusetts, including his role in winning Congressional approval for a bailout of the Chrysler Corporation and in pushing for the passage of the Alaska Lands Act. As with his first advertisement, which featured Mr. Tsongas swimming laps, the spot emphasized the former Senator's toughness and his recovery from a bout with cancer.</p><p>Senator Kerrey, who began attacking Mr. Clinton on the stump earlier this week, joined the advertising fray on Friday. He abandons the recitation of his record in the Vietnam War to discuss health care and to chide President Bush for going to Japan to "beg for a few concessions."</p><p>In his advertisement, Mr. Kerrey strides across an ice rink and likens the trade imbalance to a hockey game. "Fight back, America," an announcer intones at the end of the commercial.</p><p>Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa shot his own New Hampshire advertisements on a visit here last week, but they have yet to appear. Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, who spent much of last week campaigning in Iowa, has also not broadcast television advertisements here.</p><p>The Democrats have not been alone in the candidate-definition derby. Vice President Dan Quayle's two-day visit to the state this week marked the Bush campaign's first foray into a race made competitive, in New Hampshire at least, by the presence of Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator.</p><p>Mr. Quayle warned Republicans unhappy with Mr. Bush for backtracking on his 1988 no-new-taxes pledge that they should not use Mr. Buchanan's candidacy to send a message. "When times are difficult, don't you want and deserve the very best?" Mr. Quayle asked his New Hampshire audiences.</p><p>Mr. Buchanan took out a full-page advertisement in The Union Leader, the influential Manchester newspaper, while Mr. Quayle was visiting. It began, "Hey Dan! Where's George?" while the slogan at the bottom of the page promised, "He'll keep the promises George Bush broke."</p><p>But the most vociferous early squabbling has taken place among the Democrats, particularly between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kerrey. After Mr. Clinton's advertising hit the airwaves this week, Mr. Kerrey said his health-care plan was "more revolting than it is revolutionary," the latest in a series of jibes he has aimed at Mr. Clinton.</p><p>"Voters up here have a very short window to not just figure out who these guys are, but how they're different from each other," said Bill Shore, an adviser to Mr. Kerrey.</p><p>It is difficult to determine how much of the jockeying between Mr. Kerrey and Mr. Clinton is merely political choreography. "It's my strategy to come and argue," Mr. Kerrey cheerfully acknowledged this week. Weak Voter Interest</p><p>Most political professionals here acknowledge that voter interest and support for particular candidates remain soft, in spite of early polls showing some popularity for Mr. Tsongas, who lives in neighboring Massachusetts.</p><p>Mr. Tsongas's advertising, intended in part to leaven his serious image -- "He's no movie star," his new advertisement begins -- sends the same can-do message the other Democrats are striving for. "This is someone who gets things done in Washington," said Mike Shea, a media adviser to Mr. Tsongas. "And that's a significant point."</p><p>Similarly, Mr. Clinton's advisers are seeking to tap into the anger of the economically depressed by appealing to the middle-class frustrations they detected when they conducted interviewed groups of New Hampshire voters. "They are demanding that politicians answer their questions and tell them what you want to do," said Mitchell Schwartz, who runs Mr. Clinton's New Hampshire campaign.</p><p>Mr. Kerrey's advertisements, filmed just this week, appeared little more than a day later. In them, he assails President Bush and, by implication, any Democrat who would do less than he would. "You've got an obligation to be explicit about it, not just to put yur ideas out there, but to say how they're different from the others," said Mr. Shore, Mr. Kerrey's adviser.</p><p>Mr. Harkin, who appeals to the party's left wing, is probably the most clearly defined of the five remaining major candidates, although he has not appeared on paid television. "Tom Harkin hasn't really changed what he has been saying from the very beginning," said Kathi Rogers, Mr. Harkin's New Hampshire campaign director. "He's saying, ' "If you want real substantial change, I'm the one to vote for.' "</p><p>Each of these candidates must find a way to appeal to skeptical and economically preoccupied voters like Helena Caldwell, who has worked at an electrical plant in Hillsborough for 20 years.</p><p>"I don't really know the fellow," she said as Bob Kerrey ambled by. "Hey, they're all alike. I'd like to see them talk about the economy. It's getting bad and people are worried."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
