He directed that tax-withholding rules be changed immediately, meaning that some money normally given back later in refunds will be left in paychecks so it can be spent quickly. The change is expected to inject some $2 billion a month into the economy when fully effective. Mr. Bush also ordered Federal spending on some programs accelerated. Rewarding the Taxpayer</p><p>Challenging Congress to act within eight weeks and promising a "battle" if it does not, Mr. Bush proposed short-term relief measures like an increase in tax exemptions for children, tax breaks for first-time home buyers and the housing industry and tax credits for the purchase of health insurance by those earning low wages.

He proposed $50 billion worth of Pentagon cuts over the next five years and outlined new arms-control measures, including a proposal that the United States and the republics of the former Soviet Union eliminate all multiple-warhead nuclear missiles based on land. Mr. Bush did not make clear whether the money saved from the Pentagon would be plowed into domestic programs. Trying to Regain Stature</p><p>But the bulk of Mr. Bush's third State of the Union Message was dedicated to stopping the President's slide in the public opinion polls and strengthening him for the re-election campaign. Mr. Bush's speech was immediately criticized by Democrats, some of whom said it was too little and too late.</p><p>Earlier today, to sidestep a bitter election-year issue, Mr. Bush and House leaders agreed to spend $2.7 billion on another 13 weeks of unemployment benefits for about two million of the long-term unemployed. [ Page A18. ]</p><p>With his popularity at the lowest ebb of his three years in office, Mr. Bush sought to recapture the stature he enjoyed just one year ago as Commander in Chief in the war against Iraq and as the leader of the free world during the collapse of Communism. He even borrowed his own Persian Gulf war oratory in an effort to persuade voters that he could bring the leadership he demonstrated in battle to bear on the economy.</p><p>"We are going to lift this nation out of hard times inch by inch and day by day, and those who would stop us had better step aside," Mr. Bush declared in a line that drew loud applause in the packed chamber of the House of Representatives. "Because I look at hard times, and I make this vow: This will not stand." The pledge echoed his promise that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait would not stand.</p><p>The Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley, politely applauded Mr. Bush as the President spoke to the joint session of Congress. But afterward, he criticized the President's proposals as too little, too late. "For too long, we were told to wait, that things would get better on their own," he said in the Democrats' official response. "There was even an effort to talk us out of the recession, or to tell us that it wasn't really happening at all."</p><p>After hearing the address, some of the Democratic Presidential candidates said they were disappointed with the President's economic plans.</p><p>Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, who was campaigning at a school in Franklin, N.H., offered this: "All I can say after watching his speech is the State of the Union is coming from someone who is totally out of touch with what is happening in America." Incongruously for a speech that had been billed as his moment to define not only his campaign agenda but the second term he hopes to win in November, Mr. Bush began his remarks in the chamber of the House of Representatives tonight with two jokes. Poking Fun at Himself</p><p>"You know, with the big buildup this speech has had, I wanted to make sure it would be a big hit, but I couldn't convince Barbara to deliver it for me," he said, as the chamber erupted into laughter and applause.</p><p>He smiled again and said: "I see the Speaker and the Vice President are laughing. They saw what I did in Japan, and they're just happy they're sitting behind me."</p><p>The politicians in the House chamber interrupted Mr. Bush's speech dozens of times for applause. Sometimes the applause came from both sides of the aisle, as it did for politically popular themes like Head Start and the war in the Persian Gulf. At other times, the applause was Republican only, as when Mr. Bush spoke of cutting the capital gains tax on profits from investments.</p><p>Mr. Bush tried to paint himself as Presidential and Congress as partisan. Striking a compromise between aides who urged him to be conciliatory and those who wanted him to start battling the Democrats right away, Mr. Bush challenged lawmakers to pass his proposals by March 20.</p><p>"From the day after that, if it must be: the battle is joined," Mr. Bush said. "And you know, when principle is at stake, I relish a good fair fight." Says He Shunned 'Gimmicks'</p><p>Mr. Bush portrayed his plan as a fiscally and politically responsible effort to speed the recession's end, although it came 18 months after the recession began and one year to the day after he promised America that it would soon end, and he asserted that he had resisted the temptation for "new and dazzling" proposals or "gimmicks."</p><p>But the President spoke against the backdrop of an extraordinary buildup for the annual speech, which the President has promoted in virtually every public utterance for the past six weeks. Concerned that the advance billing was too ambitious, and still caught up in disputes that kept a major proposal on health-care reform from being included tonight, the White House tried to lower expectations at the last minute.</p><p>Heeding the advice of moderate advisers who cautioned against too sharp a break with the past, Mr. Bush made no radical departure from the economic policies he has pursued for three years, nor did he remake the political philosophies that he inherited from Ronald Reagan into his own images.</p><p>Details of the President's programs will become clearer on Wednesday when he submits his budget to Congress. Then the White House and Congress begin the complicated process of negotiations and tradeoffs in incorporating the dozens of pieces of the package into legislation.</p><p>While economists suggested that Mr. Bush's short-term proposals could help the economy, the President offered no detailed vision of the future of the country tonight. Many of the proposals he outlined were programs that he offered in the past and that Congress rejected.</p><p>Among these was a call for a reduction in the rate of taxes on capital gains, which Mr. Bush has made the centerpiece of his economic policy, to as low as 15.4 percent on the profits from the sale of assets held more than three years. The current capital gains tax rate is 28 percent.</p><p>"This time, at this hour, I cannot take 'No' for an answer," he said.</p><p>Outlining his economic programs, many of which had found their way into news reports in recent weeks, Mr. Bush said he was issuing executive orders that would impose a 90-day moratorium on all new Federal regulations that could hinder growth, and he pledged to change banking regulations to stimulate lending.</p><p>To pump money into the economy, he said, the Federal Government will accelerate spending on existing programs, for a total of $10 billion in the next six months. He also proposed a budget "freeze" that would keep spending on discretionary programs in the budget for the 1993 fiscal year at the same level as the current budget. That proposal would produce less than $5 billion in savings. Money Back Sooner</p><p>Mr. Bush ordered the Treasury Department to revise the method by which taxes are withheld from paychecks. This would have no effect on Americans' tax burdens, but would simply give them back their own money sooner. Income taxes are now withheld at a rate higher than the actual tax rate in order to provide extra money to the Federal coffers during the year, and many taxpayers receive refunds.</p><p>Mr. Bush also proposed an increase of $500 in the personal tax exemption for each child, tax credits and penalty-free withdrawals from individual retirement accounts for first-time home buyers, tax breaks for the real estate industry, tax credits and deductions for medical insurance.</p><p>Declaring that "by the grace of God, American won the cold war," Mr. Bush played to the strongly inward-looking trends that are evident in polls of American voters in this election year.</p><p>He said: "For half a century now, the American people have shouldered the burden and paid taxes than were higher than they would have been to support a defense that was bigger than it would have been if imperial Communism had never existed. But it did. Doesn't anymore."</p><p>Mr. Bush announced that the enormously expensive B-2 Stealth bomber program would be stopped after the 20 planes already being purchased. Towarde Fewer Warheads</p><p>Mr. Bush also said he was canceling production of the Midgetman nuclear missile and would halt manufacture of new warheads for sea-based nuclear missiles. No more multiple-warhead MX missiles will be built, and the military will not buy any more advanced cruise missiles, Mr. Bush said.</p><p>He said that on Saturday, when he meets with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, he would propose that if Russia eliminates all land-based missiles with more than one warhead, he will eliminate the multiple-warhead MX missile and reduce the number of warheads on the Minuteman missile to one from three.</p><p>Often criticized for seeming deadpan in the face of astonishing events, Mr. Bush said, "Even as as President, with the most fascinating possible vantage point, there were times when I was so busy helping to manage progress and lead change that I didn't always show the joy that was in my heart."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
