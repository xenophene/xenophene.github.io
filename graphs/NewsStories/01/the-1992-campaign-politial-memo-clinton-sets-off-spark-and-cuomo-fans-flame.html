Bill Clinton's Presidential campaign now faces mounting difficulties in New York -- and perhaps beyond -- because of an ethnic remark he made about Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. And, political strategists agree, Mr. Cuomo has reacted with a bit of hardball politics that seemed designed to extract a heavy political price from the Arkansas Governor.</p><p>Mr. Cuomo, who has a history of political differences with Mr. Clinton, spent much of Tuesday transforming Mr. Clinton's comment that Mr. Cuomo "acts like" a member of the Mafia into an assault on all ethnic minorities. He was not placated by Mr. Clinton's apology, and made his displeasure known not only in a news conference in Albany but also in telephone interviews with a number of reporters.</p><p>The contretemps between the two Governors became front-page news today in many New York newspapers and was picked up elsewhere across the country. By this afternoon, the conflict had started to tear at Mr. Clinton's support in New York, which many strategists believed was soft anyway because it was based more on his ability to be elected, rather than on ideological compatibility.

Yevoli, the newly elected Town Supervisor of Oyster Bay, L.I., became the first Clinton delegate in New York to announce that he would abandon the campaign. "I have no desire to participate in the Clinton campaign," Mr. Yevoli said in a telephone interview. "He's in the process of self-destructing."</p><p>Mr. Yevoli said that Gennifer Flowers's allegations that she had a 12-year affair with Mr. Clinton was not enough to poison his support. But he said he could not tolerate what he considered an "ethnic slur."</p><p>"There's no question that I'm offended," Mr. Yevoli said. "It's an offense to Italian-Americans and it's an offense to every other ethnic group."</p><p>Mr. Yevoli's defection -- he said he has not decided whom he will support -- was a testimonial to the power of ethnic politics in New York, particularly in New York City and its suburbs, where nearly 70 percent of the state's registered Democrats live.</p><p>Mr. Clinton's Democratic opponents were eager to exploit the new vulnerability they sensed in a state that has 244 delegates at stake in its April 7 primary. New York's Democratic delegate pool ranks second only to California's in size, and its primary could be pivotal if no candidate is able to wrap up the nomination in the Southern primaries in March.</p><p>Richard Socarides, New York campaign manager for Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, said he had formed a committee to reach out to Clinton supporters who now might be wavering. He also said he has encouraged Mr. Harkin to travel to New York next week to meet with potential defectors.</p><p>Senator Harkin, who is in New Hampshire campaigning, tonight criticized Governor Clinton for the comment. "The whole ethnic connection to the Mafia -- it's wrong and it should have no part in American politics," he said in an interview. "Racist remarks, ethnic, religious, derogatory remarks, have no place in our country, in our politics."</p><p>The Clinton-Cuomo confrontation began on Monday when Ms. Flowers made public a tape of what she said was a secretly recorded telephone conversation in which she and Mr. Clinton were discussing Mr. Cuomo.</p><p>"I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't have some Mafioso major connections," Ms. Flowers said.</p><p>"Well, he acts like one," Mr. Clinton responded.</p><p>Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference on Tuesday that Mr. Clinton's comment was "part of an ugly syndrome that strikes Italian-Americans, Jewish people, blacks, women, all different ethnic groups."</p><p>And Mr. Clinton's apology, in which he said he deeply regretted it "if" his remarks were perceived as offensive, only seemed to fan the flames. Mr. Cuomo said on Tuesday that Mr. Clinton should "save himself his quarter" rather than call to apologize.</p><p>Mr. Clinton today strongly dismissed any suggestion that he is insensitive to minorities. "Of all the things I might be faulted for in my public life, being insensitive to any kind of minority or ethnic group is not one of them, ever," he said while greeting voters in Hampton, N.H.</p><p>At a fund-raiser tonight in West Orange, N.J., Governor Clinton apologized to Italian-Americans and to anyone else who might have been offended by the remark about Governor Cuomo in the phone transcript. He said that while he did not have "an exact recollection" of the remark, that this was "not important."</p><p>"Wounds were caused," he said. "I want to apologize again for any hurt that was caused to any Italian-American in this region, state or country or anyone else offended" by the remark.</p><p>Governor Clinton promised that as President he would have "no more rhetoric like Willie Horton that divides by race, gender, income or anything else." A Sensitive Issue</p><p>It may not be possible to wave a flag any redder at Mr. Cuomo than by seeming to link him to the Mafia. He has combated unsubstantiated rumors about such links throughout his political career and often speaks eloquently about discrimination against Italian-Americans.</p><p>But some political strategists both inside and outside New York saw Mr. Cuomo's reaction as a case of piling on.</p><p>Although they stopped short of ascribing any motive to Mr. Cuomo, who says the state budget still precludes him from joining the race, they said he seemed unaffected by the knowledge that the Democratic front-runner was already reeling from Ms. Flowers's allegations. 'Stirring the Pot'</p><p>"I don't know if it was a politically prudent response -- it sort of puts Cuomo back in the position of stirring the pot," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic poll taker in Washington. "But it might have been a personally justified response."</p><p>Before Mr. Cuomo relinquished the front-runner's role to Mr. Clinton last month by deciding against running, the two were cast as the polar extremes of the Democratic race.</p><p>Mr. Cuomo regularly assailed the moderate agenda set by the Democratic Leadership Council, which was led by by Mr. Clinton, while Mr. Clinton once referred to Mr. Cuomo as "a powerful spokesman for the Northeast liberal base of the party."</p><p>Anne W. Crowley, Mr. Cuomo's press secretary, denied that Mr. Cuomo's reaction was driven by his relationship with Mr. Clinton.</p><p>"Regardless of who had made this comment, he would have responded just the same," she said.</p><p>While many Clinton supporters in New York and elsewhere were forgiving, some Italian-Americans predicted that the remark would have a cost for Mr. Clinton.</p><p>"That didn't go over well with the Italians here," said Charles Cagno, a retired builder in Tampa, Fla. "I hope they don't blackball him."</p><p>But others said they were insulted that the conflict had become an issue. "This is ridiculous. It's more tabloid stuff," said Edward Aloise, owner of Cafe Pavone in Manchester, N.H. "The whole scenario is overshadowing what really counts in an election."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
