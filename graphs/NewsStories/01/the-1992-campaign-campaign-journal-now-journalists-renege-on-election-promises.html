In fact, this week there were two events on national television that could ultimately qualify as official defining moments.</p><p>The first, of course, was when Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas went on "60 Minutes" to make what was probably the most public confession in the history of marriage problems. The next came Tuesday night when Mr. Clinton's confession was analyzed -- along with questions on the economy and President Bush's understanding of the middle class -- by what was probably the largest biased sample in the history of instant polling.</p><p>This sort of thing was not supposed to happen in 1992. Academics and politicians and journalists have spent much of the last four years preparing reports on what went wrong in 1988: obsessive coverage of supposed character issues, endless analysis of strategies and polls instead of who stood for what. Studies showed that a majority of the press coverage concerned the horse race, not the issues.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-first-para--></div><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ln-ctr-top" style="" class="mod-nytimesline mod-line"><!-- Module starts: ln-ctr-top (Line) --><center><div style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc; height:1px; width:350px;"></div></center><!-- Module ends: ln-ctr-top--></div><!-- Area starts: main-center-center --><div id="area-main-center-center" style=""><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ctr-lt-in-top" style="float:left;" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-lt-in-top (AdCpc) -->

Is it all right to report a supermarket tabloid's allegation of adultery? And if not, why did we just do it, and why can't we stop talking about it? Would the State of the Union Message be a defining moment or a victim of the expectations game? How was Bill Clinton's television strategy affecting the polls? How were the polls affecting the President's television strategy? Didn't Seem Worthwhile</p><p>This coverage seems to have made the public even more unhappy than usual with the press. Polls this week showed that most people considered accusations of marital infidelity an unimportant issue, but the extensive publicity guaranteed that these accusations were the only thing that many voters knew about Mr. Clinton. Here in New Hampshire it is unusual to find anyone who approves of the way the story has been covered.</p><p>"I'm trying not to pay any attention to all the stuff about Clinton supposedly having an affair," said Mary Ann Foley, 34 years old, who is training to be a truck driver in Londonderry. "I know the press is in the business of selling newspapers and getting ratings, but I don't think it's right. I want to hear about the issues. I'd like to find out more about Paul Tsongas's positions."</p><p>This campaign started with good intentions and a spate of articles and television pieces on the issues and the candidates' views. The economy was discussed at length, and some newspapers and newscasts went beyond the candidates' positions to present what may be the most important bit of economic information for voters: Most economists think that politicians' current proposals would do little to end the recession and could be damaging in the long term.</p><p>But such issues got pushed aside this week by the Clinton tabloid story, which soon made it to front pages and the top of newscasts. It got confusing. On Tuesday, The Boston Globe's front page proclaimed, "Poll Shows Clinton's Lead Undiminished," while The Boston Herald's banner headline said, "Clinton on the Run." Meanwhile, analysts on television programs like "Nightline" berated themselves for considering such a sordid topic. The passionate discussions usually began with a disclaimer that carried all the moral authority of "We can't go on meeting like this." Quick and Skewed</p><p>And then there were the polls, the campaign strategists' reactions to the polls, and the voters' reactions to the strategists' reactions. By the time President Bush delivered the State of the Union Message on Tuesday night, the chief question raised by analysts on television was not whether his proposals made any sense but how the Democrats and voters would respond to his staff's strategy.</p><p>The most ambitious effort to gauge reaction was conducted by CBS immediately after the speech in a program called "America on the Line." It invited viewers to make free phone calls to computers in Omaha and participate in the biggest instant telephone poll ever held. Within a few minutes the computers had heard from 74,200 callers across the country, and Connie Chung reported a result: 53 percent of the callers said they were worse off than four years ago.</p><p>"It's important to note here that this is quite dramatic," she said to Dan Rather, and explained that a CBS News poll a month earlier had found only 30 percent of people in the worse-off category. "Dan, it's gone up to 53 percent. Perhaps the group that's calling us now, these across the country, are quite upset, quite angry. This does not bode well for President Bush on the night of his sState of the Union."</p><p>Well, it would not have boded well for President Bush if he had had to talk to those angry thousands -- or pay for the calls -- but otherwise it meant very little. Science by the Wayside</p><p>The instant poll involved an unrepresentative sample of Americans, those who were still tuned in after the State of the Union address, from which were selected only those sufficiently motivated to reach the computer in Omaha -- no mean feat, since only about 1 out of every 100 calls got through. And it was further biased by the stories of desperate unemployed and sick people that the viewers were shown during the polling.</p><p>"It's a good measure of the number of people who are watching the network and of the intensity of the feelings that lead them to respond," said Philip E. Meyer, an expert in polling who teaches at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "But it's of no value at all as a measurement of the distribution of public opinion on an issue."</p><p>To CBS's credit, it also conducted a nationwide survey of a randomly selected sample, and Dan Rather briefly reported the result: 32 percent of 1,241 people surveyed considered themselves worse off than four years ago, or about the same as in the poll a month previously. So much for the dramatic change.</p><p>But by the end of the program Ms. Chung was again talking about the people's pessimistic mood as the tally of callers grew to 314,726. The final result showed that 54 percent declared themsleves worse off, 70 percent thought President Bush did not understand the middle class, and 45 percent were not satisfied with Mr. Clinton's televised confession.</p><p>Mr. Rather closed with a solemn word about the importance of voting, although it was not exactly clear what voters were supposed to have learned. Perhaps they could conclude that people who have time to call a computer in Omaha also have time to worry about Mr. Clinton's personal life -- although probably not as much time as the nation's journalists.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
