The legislation would expand tax deductions for health insurance for the self-employed and provide continuity of coverage for workers changing jobs. "Later, we'll federalize low-income access to medical care," he said.</p><p>The recession has aggravated the problem of how to extend access to health care to the 35 million Americans who are uninsured or underinsured, without breaking the Federal treasury and fueling inflation. Among the uninsured are 450,000 pregnant women, increasing the likelihood that they will not seek the prenatal care they may need to avert premature delivery, an important factor in birth defects.</p><p>New layoffs have increased the number of uninsured in recent months, while the more gradual employment trend away from manufacturing toward the service sector has put workers in jobs that are less likely to provide coverage. And as fewer workers are insured, fewer of their dependents are covered. Town Meetings by Democrats</p><p>At the same time, the costs of health care have outstripped the rate of inflation by a considerable margin for more than a decade, making it more difficult for individuals and businesses to afford the health insurance plans they are enrolled in. The Commerce Department estimated that Americans spent about $817 billion on health care in 1991, about 11 percent more than in 1990.</p><p>House Democrats will try to exploit growing public concerns by holding 200 town meetings around the country on Tuesday night to publicize their various health-care proposals and put President Bush on the defensive. Representative Vic Fazio of California, the organizer of the events, said: "It's going to be a very interesting and educational campaign debate, which will be the precursor of real fundamental change in the aftermath of the campaign."</p><p>Democrats and Republicans have been jockeying for advantage on health care since last November when Senator Harris Wofford, a Democrat, defeated former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh in a special Pennsylvania election largely by contending that all Americans deserved decent medical care. Only hours after the polls closed, dozens of Senate and House members, including an unusual number of Republicans, made speeches criticizing President Bush for moving too slowly to develop a health-care policy.</p><p>In the last week, Administration officials responded to the pressure by embracing a number of proposals already outlined by Republican members of Congress, including restrictions on medical malpractice lawsuits and the establishment of new incentives for people to enroll in prepaid group health plans like health maintenance organizations.</p><p>Labor Secretary Lynn Martin and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Louis W. Sullivan, sharpened the debate on Thursday when they charged that a plan favored by Senator Mitchell to force employers to provide health insurance would devastate small businesses and cause higher unemployment.</p><p>Senator Mitchell shrugged off Administration criticism, saying he was happy President Bush was responding to the political pressure. "Just getting the President to discuss the issue is an accomplishment," he said, adding that another dip in the President's popularity would increase the possibility that major insurance legislation could be passed and signed this year.</p><p>Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, Democrat of West Virginia, has been pressing Democratic Presidential candidates to hone their message on the issue by organizing two debates exclusively devoted to health care. In the first, only Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts offered detailed plans. But Mr. Rockefeller hopes the other candidates will be forced to tackle the issue before the next debate. 30 Plans Before Congress</p><p>"You have to think of building political pressure through the political process," said Mr. Rockefeller, who is sponsoring a bill that would phase in requirements for employers to provide health insurance or pay an additional payroll tax to finance Government-supplied insurance. "I think the Presidential campaign helps the legislative prospects on health care."</p><p>Of the more than 30 health-care insurance bills now before Congress, only a couple that offer tax incentives to extend coverage appear to have a real chance for quick enactment. National health insurance has substantial support in the House but far less than it needs to win in the Senate. Plans like Mr. Mitchell's and Mr. Rockefeller's are gaining momentum, but opposition from Congressional conservatives and the White House is stiff.</p><p>One viable bill, proposed by Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, and supported by the Republican Senate leadership, would provide employers and employees who cannot deduct health insurance costs with tax incentives to buy coverage, and encourage small businesses to form insurance-buying groups to limit rate increases. It would also put controls on medical malpractice suits to lower insurance costs of doctors and hospitals. These costs are usually passed on to patients.</p><p>"The Chafee bill can be passed," said Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, "but it won't end the debate."</p><p>Mr. Packwood predicted that within three years the Government would enact either national health insurance or sweeping mandates requiring businesses to provide and pay for the health insurance of their employees. "The battle will come between those two plans," he said.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
