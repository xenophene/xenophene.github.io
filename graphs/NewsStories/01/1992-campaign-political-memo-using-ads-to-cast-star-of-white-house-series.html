It is still easy to find serious television viewers who cannot recall the name of a single Democratic candidate. Some people even claim they have not seen any of the advertisements.</p><p>But some of the state's voters are trying to sort out the advertisements. They realize that all the promises sound the same, and they do not expect the promises to be kept anyway, but they still hope the commercials will guide them in making a crucial decision for the Presidential primary on Feb. 18: Which of these guys would be the least painful to watch on television for four years?</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-first-para--></div><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ln-ctr-top" style="" class="mod-nytimesline mod-line"><!-- Module starts: ln-ctr-top (Line) --><center><div style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc; height:1px; width:350px;"></div></center><!-- Module ends: ln-ctr-top--></div><!-- Area starts: main-center-center --><div id="area-main-center-center" style=""><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ctr-lt-in-top" style="float:left;" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-lt-in-top (AdCpc) -->

Recently unemployed for six months, Mr. Fraser is as worried as anyone about the economy, but his choice is not based on economic policies. He could not immediately name the details of his candidate's economic program. In fact, he could not immediately name the candidate.</p><p>"He's the one with gray hair, says he has a comprehensive program -- what's his name?" Mr. Fraser said. "There's a phone number -- and he sits on a desk, maybe?" Mr. Fraser thought about it for a minute, gave up, and let another salesman at the store match the spot with the name: Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas.</p><p>"Yeah, he's the one, Clinton," Mr. Fraser said. "He looked like he'd be comfortable giving you what you want to hear."</p><p>That may not be the sort of deliberation that the Founding Fathers had in mind for choosing the President, but there are worse criteria. With candidates so well-trained to avoid the specific or the unpopular, voters can't be sure what Presidential policies they will have to suffer through, but they know they'll have to endure the President's talking head every night on television.</p><p>Mr. Clinton is doing well in the air war, partly because his advertisements have been on so often, but also because he seems more calmly authoritative than most television news announcers, both in his advertisements that run during newscasts and in his appearances on the programs.</p><p>On the Friday evening newscast here he was not even ruffled by newspaper reports on accusations that he had had extramarital affairs, accusations made by an Arkansas employee who was dismissed in 1988. The videotape showed the Governor hounded by reporters but serene as ever, smiling and patiently explaining that these were old and long-since discredited accusations.</p><p>Then he appeared live on the WMUR-TV newscast and was asked a question that many politicians would consider unfair: "Have you ever had an extramarital affair, Governor?" Mr. Clinton showed no indignation or unease. "Well," he replied with a Reaganesque chuckle, "if I had, I wouldn't tell you."</p><p>Mr. Clinton's advertisements flash newspaper headlines and show him with construction workers, but they mostly consist of him in an office talking directly to the camera. He makes general promises about the middle class and urges viewers to call for a copy of his plan.</p><p>The other candidates' advertisements seem more elaborately produced, which is always a risk. It invites comparisons with other commercials, and politicians can rarely match those happy actors selling beer and detergent.</p><p>The advertisements for Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska show him on a hockey rink, where he talks about trade. "Others guard their goal to keep our products out while we leave our net open," he says, and promises that the Japanese will "find out this President can play a little defense, too." His gaze might be a little too intense, and television viewers may have special reason to wonder what this Presidential goalie plans to keep out. Does a victory by the American team mean no more Sony Trinitrons?</p><p>The advertising for Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa shows him in shirtsleeves trying to rouse a crowd by shouting, "Let's have resource-based economics!" He has the exuberance of a good stump speaker, but when he waxes enthusiastic about new programs -- "I want to be known as the President that rebuilt America!" -- his passion can be disconcerting on the small screen, particularly to viewers who do not want to be known as the ones who paid for the renovation. Beyond the Pretty Pictures</p><p>The most noteworthy aspect of the spots for former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts is what's missing: his voice. The reason seems obvious to anyone who has watched Mr. Tsongas be interviewed. Although he seems quite thoughtful, his message tends to get lost in his mushy diction. His advertising avoids this by relying on a narrator and a collage of scenes: mountains, assembly-line workers, Mr. Tsongas swimming laps. But the advertisements can leave even distracted viewers like Doreen Fontaine unsatisfied.</p><p>"Yes, Tsongas, I saw him swimming, but he didn't say too much from what I gathered," said Ms. Fontaine, a 50-year-old nurse from Londonderry. She said she hadn't really had time to pay attention to the advertisements or the candidates' interviews on television, but she was beginning to make up her mind.</p><p>"There was one that impressed me," she said. "I can't remember exactly what it was he wanted. I think it was for the working man and the economy, and something about health insurance. He seemed like he had confidence in what he was saying. He had a plan, I think. What was his name? Clinton. Is that one of the Democrats?"</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
