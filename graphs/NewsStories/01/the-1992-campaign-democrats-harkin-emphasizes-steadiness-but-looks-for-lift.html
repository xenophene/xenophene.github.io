Just steady as she goes."</p><p>This is Mr. Harkins's effort to get his audience to ignore early polls and some pundits' predictions by making a virtue of his own perserverance as Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska have enjoyed more of the highs so far.</p><p>Although the first voting in the Presidential campaign is more than four weeks away, there are signs that Mr. Harkin could use a lift: His fund-raising has been sluggish; he has not kept pace in early polls, and he has been struggling to hang on to support from influential labor groups.</p><p>Even Mr. Harkin was at a loss for concrete examples that his campaign was winning over voters in the first primary state. "Patience," the Iowa Democrat said in an interview. "Patience. I'll catch up. My strategy is to peak on Election Day."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-first-para--></div><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ln-ctr-top" style="" class="mod-nytimesline mod-line"><!-- Module starts: ln-ctr-top (Line) --><center><div style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc; height:1px; width:350px;"></div></center><!-- Module ends: ln-ctr-top--></div><!-- Area starts: main-center-center --><div id="area-main-center-center" style=""><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ctr-lt-in-top" style="float:left;" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-lt-in-top (AdCpc) -->

He said the campaign's first two television advertisements, which were unveiled today for use in New Hampshire, were intended to help change that.</p><p>The two 30-second television commercials introduced Mr. Harkin as the candidate who would rebuild the nation with new investments. The advertising, created by Ken Swope, a Boston-based consultant, came later than that for Mr. Clinton or Mr. Kerrey. But Mr. Harkin's aides said they would make up for the later start by buying more time for their commercials.</p><p>One advertisement is of a shirt-sleeved Mr. Harkin at his announcement speech at an Iowa steak fry last September, promising to build new roads, bridges and schools and health care for everyone. "No more trickle down," he says, with American flags as his backdrop. "Let's have resource-based economics. Put it in at the bottom and let it percolate up for a while."</p><p>In the other commercial, Mr. Harkin sits calmly in a chair, a darkened room behind him, telling an unseen interviewer that the nation is wasting too much money on tax breaks for the rich and spending overseas. "I want to be known as the President that rebuilt America," he says.</p><p>Joseph Grandmaison, a former Democratic chairman in New Hampshire, said that while some polls had shown Mr. Harkin lagging in the state, he still had enough time to turn his fortunes around. "Voter support can turn on a dime in this state," he said. "My sense of Harkin is that he's very comfortable with what he has to say and delivers his message exceptionally well. There's an interest in seeing what the substance of his programs are as opposed to exclusively Bush bashing." A Catchy New Slogan</p><p>Yet in dozens of appearances over the past several days in Iowa, South Dakota, New Hampshire and Ohio, Mr. Harkin sought to distinguish himself from the other Democrats by presenting himself as the only candidate who could beat President Bush because he was a fiery campaigner whose devotion to traditional Democratic values made him the clearest alternative to the President.</p><p>In a catchy new slogan written by an aide that has brought Mr. Harkin laughs at every stop, he asserts: "I'm not a microwave Democrat."</p><p>He then compares his opponents to leftovers he heated up in the microwave: "Took it out. It was steamy and hot. I cut into it. It was hot on the outside and cold on the inside. I thought that's like a lot of those Democrats out there running. Boy, they sound like great Democrats. But you pull away the layers and it's still cold, hard-hearted Republicanism."</p><p>Mr. Harkin seems to be banking on the hope that his opponents will falter. Asked in an interview what he needed to gain momentum, he talked not about himself but about two opponents: Mr. Kerrey and Mr. Clinton.</p><p>While the two rivals rarely mention Mr. Harkin as they campaign through New Hampshire, the Senator readily attacks them. In appearances in South Dakota last week, where he and Mr. Kerrey are both presenting themselves as practically native sons, Mr. Harkin derided the centerpiece of Mr. Kerrey's campaign, a national health care plan, saying "we don't need more taxes on small business."</p><p>In a subsequent interview, he criticized Mr. Kerrey as lacking experience. "I don't think that he's been seasoned enough in one term as Governor of Nebraska and three years as a Senator. It's almost becoming clear to many people that he is trying to position himself for 1996."</p><p>As for Mr. Clinton, Mr. Harkin asserted that the Governor's support would erode once people learned more about him. He contended that Mr. Clinton's strategy was "to be all things to all people -- conservative to conservatives and liberal to liberals," and that Mr. Clinton had benefited from favorable press coverage because "someone told me that for years he's been schmoozing with the press."</p><p>Pressed on why Democrats want another liberal after the defeats of Mr. Dukakis and Mr. Mondale, Mr. Harkin said they "weren't aggressive enough."</p><p>Explaining this philosophy to a small but enthusiastic group of union workers in Rapid City, S.D., the other day, Mr. Harkin said: "There are people saying, 'Harkin can't win,' I submit to you, there's a little bit of difference between me and Mike Dukakis. When they swing at me, they'd better duck."</p><p>But even many who came out to see Mr. Harkin, and would like to see him in the White House, question the depth of yearning for an old-fashioned Democrat.</p><p>"The guys are looking at Clinton and Kerrey," said Ritchie Nordstrom, a Harkin backer, said of his fellow A.F.S.C.M.E. union members in Rapid City. Despite Mr. Harkin's reputation as the closest to labor among the contenders, he said, "I guess they feel that Clinton is more electable nationally."</p><p>At another forum in Rapid City, Millie Payne, president of the Western South Dakota Alzheimers Association, came away wondering how Mr. Harkin would finance his sweeping health care program, a question the Senator said he has not resolved himself.</p><p>"I felt that he had some good ideas," Ms. Payne said, "But there is going to have to be some way to pay for everyone in the country having medical care. We'd all love it, but the money has to come from somewhere."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
