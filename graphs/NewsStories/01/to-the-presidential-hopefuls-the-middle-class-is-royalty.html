And Democrats are campaigning for that support far more relentlessly and explicitly than they did in 1988.</p><p>The five major candidates for the Democratic nomination are scrambling to cast themselves as the candidates best able to restore the American dream to "the forgotten middle class," as Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas describes it in his new television commercial in New Hampshire.</p><p>The Democratic candidates are talking about national health care plans, tax cuts for the mid-income group, expanded college loan programs and a host of other measures aimed at a broad swath of people squeezed by the recession.</p><p>For his part, President Bush is apparently preparing a new budget that will offer tax credits to help people buy health insurance, tax benefits for first-time home buyers and a flurry of other measures aimed at showing his concern for working families.</p><p>Republican strategists say they will not make the mistakes their party made in losing last year's Pennsylvania Senate race, when the Democrats hammered at the health care issue, a principal concern of many voters, and the Republicans responded only in the final days.</p><p>Many Republicans say it would be dangerous for the White House to look disengaged on such issues in this campaign.</p><p>"Bush has a long way to go here domestically, and step one is to reconnect, to show that he understands reality here at home, to let people know that he's aware of what they're going through," said one Republican strategist close to the Bush campaign organization. Other Issues Seen</p><p>Still, that strategist argued: "If you look at the middle class as just this monolithic group driven by economic self-interest, I think that's wrong. And I think that's what the Democrats are doing right now, and I think they'll get blind-sided by a whole set of values and other issues that will appeal to these voters."</p><p>Many strategists shy away from defining the term middle class, noting that income guidelines fail to take into account such variables as the number of children in a family or the local cost of living. Moreover, part of the political magic of the term is that most Americans, black and white, consider themselves part of the middle class, according to some public opinion polls.</p><p>But Paul Tully, political director of the Democratic National Committee, speaks of a critical middle-class voter as a suburbanite, in a household with about $35,000 income, younger than 45, with a child or two, and in a marriage in which both partners work. James Carville, a Democratic strategist working for Mr. Clinton and an architect of the Democratic victory in Pennsylvania, talks of a "32-year-old with two kids in day care who works in some suburban office building."</p><p>Robert D. Reischauer, head of the Congressional Budget Office, views the middle class as the middle 60 percent of Americans by income, which for a family of four would be from $19,000 to $78,000. He adds, however, that attitudes can be as telling as income: "Most people think of the life style they can afford, the amount of discretionary income." Baggage to Unload</p><p>In this struggle for the middle-income voter, each party has some baggage to unload. The Republicans have to fight the perception that they care most about the rich; the Democrats have to make the case that they are ready to lead again, and counter a decade of charges that they are addicted to big-spending Government programs and care most about the poor.</p><p>In 1984, when the Democratic nominee, Walter F. Mondale, campaigned for "fairness," many middle-income voters heard it as a plea for the poor, not for them, says Stan Greenberg, a poll taker for Mr. Clinton.</p><p>Today, some poll takers say, the middle class feels neglected by the entire system.</p><p>"Probably the single biggest point of consensus among voters today is that the middle class is ignored by the political system and paying a steep economic price for it," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic poll taker. Some Democratic strategists assert that this anger results from a fundamental reassessment of the Reagan years, about who prospered and who did not. As a result, they argue, the anger will outlive the recession. 'Something Wrong'</p><p>"Even if we have 3 percent economic growth by Election Day, I still think the right Democrat with the right economic message can win," says Mr. Carville. "I think people understand there is something wrong with Republican leadership that goes beyond expansions and contractions."</p><p>Robert M. Teeter, the campaign chairman for Mr. Bush, says that middle-class voters will not simply respond to a laundry list of Government programs. "The reason we've done well with the middle class over the past 10 years is we've been for the things that helped them, whether it's on tax policies, family values or national security. We've been closer to them than the Democrats have, and I don't think that's changed."</p><p>Still, many Democratic strategists say they have learned from their mistakes in the 1980's, when middle-class voters defected in droves as Republicans portrayed the Democrats, again and again, as a party outside the American mainstream. Values were an important part of the Republicans' appeal to middle-income voters, many strategists say. This year, in addition to their economic promises, the Democratic candidates talk often of their party's commitment to the traditional values of hard work, personal responsibility and patriotism. Small-Town Roots</p><p>Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, for example, talks of his small-town roots and the values it gave him; Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska talks of the yearning of parents that their children surpass them. Mr. Clinton talks of the need for greater personal responsibility in welfare programs and corporate suites.</p><p>From a policy perspective, the Democrats are focusing on issues with similarly broad constituencies: better schools, affordable health care, middle-income tax cuts.</p><p>"A lot of Democratic policy thinking used to be directed toward lower-income people," said Mr. Garin. "Now, there's a recognition that we've got to be fighting for the middle-class people who are the backbone of the country and the heart of the electorate."</p><p>Tim Raftis, campaign manager for Mr. Harkin, says: "The Democrats need to do a much better job, and I think in this campaign they have, in communicating and talking to the ordinary concerns of working people. Most people have a deep and abiding concern for the homeless and the less fortunate in our society, but it's hard to lend a helping hand when your own footing is pretty slippery."</p><p>Many Democrats see this new middle-class politics as a striking change in their party. Mr. Greenberg said he used to encounter resistance from some of his fellow Democrats about explicit appeals to the middle class; they worried, Mr. Greenberg said, that it might seem to exclude the poor or lower-income groups. "But it's an inclusive concept," the poll taker said.</p><p>Still, Mr. Teeter asserts that the Democrats may be congratulating themselves too soon. "They can get up and say middle class four times in each paragraph, but if they enunciate policies that the middle class don't think will help them, it won't do any good."</p><p>Mr. Teeter argued that the middle class still worries about Government spending and still has doubts about the effectiveness of using Federal programs to solve many of the nation's problems, two concerns that hampered the Democrats throughout the 1980's.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
