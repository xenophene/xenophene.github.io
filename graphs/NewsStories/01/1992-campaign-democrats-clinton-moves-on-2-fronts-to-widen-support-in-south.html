Bill Clinton of Arkansas is trying to sew up the support of the mostly white Democratic establishments in those states and also garner enough endorsements from black officials to shore up his standing with minority and liberal voters.</p><p>The Clinton strategy has produced early results in party organizations, bringing him endorsements from moderates like Gov. Zell Miller of Georgia. He has also been endorsed by Representative John Lewis of Georgia, a civil rights pioneer, and Representative Mike Espy of Mississippi, the first black Congressman from that state since Reconstruction.</p><p>So far, the other Democratic candidates have not done much campaigning in the South, beyond assembling bare-bones networks of support.</p><p>Supporters of other Democrats are trying to slow Mr. Clinton's momentum by warning Democratic leaders not to rush the nomination struggle to a premature finish. Organizers for Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska have encouraged uncommitted officeholders to await the outcome of the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 18. Mr. Kerrey's supporters have suggested that their candidate's Vietnam War record could catch on with Southern voters.</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-first-para--></div><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ln-ctr-top" style="" class="mod-nytimesline mod-line"><!-- Module starts: ln-ctr-top (Line) --><center><div style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc; height:1px; width:350px;"></div></center><!-- Module ends: ln-ctr-top--></div><!-- Area starts: main-center-center --><div id="area-main-center-center" style=""><div class="float" style="clear:both;"><img src="http://nytimes.perfectmarket.com/pm/images/pixel.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="" /></div><div id="mod-ctr-lt-in-top" style="float:left;" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-lt-in-top (AdCpc) -->

A week earlier, five other states, including Georgia, will hold their primaries.</p><p>But before a single vote has been cast above or below the Mason-Dixon line, Governor Clinton has begun quietly gaining guarantees of support in Texas as well as in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma.</p><p>"Clinton has managed to gather a lot of support and convince people that he is someone who can win and present a moderate viewpoint," said Jim Mattox, the former State Attorney General who lost the 1989 Democratic gubernatorial primary to Ann Richards, now the Governor. "Whether he has strong appeal with overall voters out here, I don't think anybody has any idea." Looking for a Winner</p><p>Like many Southern politicians Mr. Mattox finds himself in a quandary. Senator Harkin's campaign identifies Mr. Mattox as a supporter, but he said in an interview, "The truth of the matter is, I'd like to go with the candidate who can win." Just in case, he met with Mr. Clinton when the Arkansas Governor was in Austin last week.</p><p>Part of Mr. Clinton's intrinsic appeal is regional, his Southern supporters freely admit. But he has also clearly outhustled his competitors in Texas and elsewhere, intent on shoring up a natural base that can serve as a backstop for his ambitions should his campaign falter in New Hampshire or in another early primary in South Dakota. Mr. Kerrey is presumed to have his own regional appeal in South Dakota.</p><p>Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts has established only a token Southern base in Florida, and party workers in other Southern states report no sightings of an organization for Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California.</p><p>"The conventional wisdom is that everybody else ought to withdraw from the race and start working on the Clinton inauguration," said Shelton Smith, a Houston lawyer and Democratic fund-raiser who is working for Mr. Kerrey, adding, "which I think is silly."</p><p>In South Carolina, Kevin Gray, a Harkin adviser who ran the Rev. Jesse Jackson's successful campaign there in 1988, said Mr. Harkin could defeat Mr. Clinton by appealing to the same coalition of black voters, labor unionists and liberals that helped Mr. Jackson.</p><p>"I don't even understand to any degree why progressives are looking at Clinton," Mr. Gray said. "If you win and you remove all of your principles in the process, you don't win anything. And I think that's what a lot of people are doing."</p><p>On Super Tuesday in 1988, more than 8.8 million Democrats voted in 14 Southern and border states, but the results were not definitive. Fewer delegates are at stake this time, and many states have grown disenchanted with the idea of Super Tuesday, which forced candidates to leapfrog among regional airports and television studios rather than spending any significant time in a state.</p><p>Georgia and South Carolina, which will hold their primaries in the weeks before Super Tuesday, will serve as a sort of gateway to the South this year. Other states like Alabama, which will not hold its contest until June 2, have spread out the single-day impact of a multistate Southern vote.</p><p>"I hope somebody wraps it up by then," said Al LaPierre, the chairman of the Alabama Democratic Party, referring to his state's primary date. "I think that's the best way to beat George Bush." Valuable Lesson for Clinton</p><p>A candidate like Mr. Clinton has also been forced to take into account the lessons learned by Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, who virtually ignored early 1988 Presidential contests in the North with the hope that the Southern primaries would propel him to the nomination. Such regional appeal, however, proved insufficient to overcome the subsequent strength in New York and Pennsylvania of the party's eventual nominee in 1988, Michael S. Dukakis.</p><p>But the Democrats understand that without convincing victories in the South, the nomination as well as the general election will remain well out of reach. So the telephone lines of the politically connected are buzzing.</p><p>Hazel Obey, the chairman of the Texas chapter of the group founded by Mr. Jackson, the Rainbow Coalition, said she had received phone calls from both Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary, as well as from the Clinton campaign chairman, David Wilhelm, asking for her support. Mr. Harkin's people, on the other hand, contacted her only once, and then to invite her to breakfast with the Iowa Senator at 6:45 the next morning. She said she would probably support Mr. Clinton.</p><p>Such critical stroking has won Mr. Clinton support in Mississippi, where Representative Espy has agreed to serve as co-chairman of the Clinton campaign; in Louisiana, where Representative William J. Jefferson recently was the host at a lunch for the Governor, and in Florida, where he won a December straw poll of Democrats.</p><p>Last week, Mr. Clinton received the near-unanimous endorsement of the Mexican-American Democrats' convention in Laredo, Tex., something that eluded the party's Spanish-speaking nominee, Mr. Dukakis, in 1988. Endorsements of 'Somebodies'</p><p>"We're in the enviable position of, somebody's got to get an endorsement to beat us," said Garry Mauro, the Texas Land Commissioner who is running Mr. Clinton's campaign in the state. "We're going to get more than our share of the somebodies. I don't know where the average person is going to go."</p><p>The candidate viewed as most likely to erode Mr. Clinton's early strength in his home region is Mr. Kerrey. The Kerrey campaign is depending on good news from New Hampshire, Colorado and South Dakota before it turns its full attention to the South.</p><p>But Mr. Smith, of the Kerrey campaign, acknowledged that they "just got steamrollered" by Clinton supporters at the convention of Mexican-American Democrats and added, "Clinton has spent so much time in Texas, it's like he's running for Governor of the state."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-ctr-in-bt" style="" class="mod-adcpc"><!-- Module starts: ctr-in-bt (AdCpc) -->
