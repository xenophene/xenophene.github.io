Among the six major announced Democratic candidates, he is clearly one of the also-rans in raising money, organizing a campaign staff, and, perhaps most significantly, honing a sharp message.</p><p>Wilder has been called a political chameleon, a man with no fixed ideological address. In his home state, he has a reputation both for opportunistically switching sides on issues and for coldly turning on his friends. Those who know him say he is so consumed with politics -- politics as process rather than politics as ideas -- that he seldom talks about anything else.</p><p>He can fly from Richmond, his state capital, to Concord, N.H., a one-hour trip on his Commonwealth of Virginia jet, and never look out the window, not even when the dome of the Capitol of the United States looms on the horizon, nor when the towers of Manhattan suddenly jut up directly below. He is too busy talking politics, holding forth from his special seat embroidered with the state's golden seal. But there is no talk here of programs or reforms, nothing about how to house the homeless or how to deal with Boris Yeltsin -- only about how the political game is played.</p><p>"Now you take my friend Bill Fears," he says, referring to a veteran Virginia State Senator who failed to win re-election last fall. "He's always loved to run that mouth. It finally caught up with him when he made that quip about how some new drunk-driver law would take all the fun out of driving. Killed him. Just killed him. He didn't really mean it. But when you're a public figure. . . ."</p><p>The words are still tumbling out when the plane taxis up to a waiting limousine in Concord.</p><p>Politics is more than Doug Wilder's one true love. Politics is his best friend.</p><p>OVER MORE THAN TWO DECADES in politics, Doug Wilder has never lost an election. In Virginia, voters have succumbed time after time to the man's considerable charms, his quick wit and his easy courtliness, a trait that moves him, even as Governor, to hold open doors for others and to bow from the waist when greeting women. True, Virginians are disenchanted with Wilder now, angry that he is running for President after only two years in the Governor's mansion and at a time when the state faces its worst economic crisis in half a century. But over the years, they have habitually forgiven Wilder his flaws, and have rewritten political and racial history by making him the first black since Reconstruction to serve in the State Senate (from 1970 to 1986) and then by electing him Lieutenant Governor in 1985 and Governor in 1989.</p><p>Now the question is whether the kind of politics that has worked for Wilder for nearly 25 years in Virginia will play beyond the state's borders. With the Feb. 18 primary in New Hampshire only five weeks away, the smart money says Wilder's candidacy is in trouble, that he has a lot of catching up to do if he is to execute his game plan: to stay alive through New Hampshire and then to try to make a strong showing in early March in the Southern primaries, where he hopes to be able to attract large blocs of black voters.</p><p>The Governor, the conventional political wisdom says, is out of his depth, politically adrift with no real campaign organization (what strategizing there is comes almost exclusively from Wilder himself and his longtime political adviser, Paul Goldman) and no real money (as of late December, he'd raised only $198,315, which put him dead last in the Democratic field). But Wilder's supporters point out that the Governor has always been a slow starter; his Virginia campaigns were all plagued in the early going by loose organization and vague message. By the end, however, he has consistently managed to find a symbol or issue that not only draws donors and energizes his campaign organization but also powerfully connects with voters. In his 1985 campaign for Lieutenant Governor, for instance, he grabbed the attention of Virginia's electorate with a marathon 1,500-mile trek back and forth across the state in a modest station wagon.</p><p>If Wilder can find a way to capture a significant portion of black voters in the early primaries -- to fill the void created by the Rev. Jesse Jackson's absence -- he could go to the Democratic convention in New York City next summer with some leverage. His campaign has begun to focus more and more on racial issues, but Wilder, whose speeches tend to drone on and on rather than soar soulfully, is no Jesse Jackson when it comes to galvanizing the black electorate.</p><p>While conceding that his candidacy is "the longest of long shots," Wilder insists nonetheless that he is electable. Over and over he repeats what has become a kind of personal mantra: "I expect to be elected President of the United States."</p><p>Still, there is little evidence so far that predominantly liberal Democratic voters are ready to nominate a card-carrying fiscal conservative, and even less evidence that a black man can be elected President should he somehow be nominated. So why is Doug Wilder -- barely halfway through his four-year term as Governor of a state with more than its share of knotty financial problems -- embarking on this seemingly hopeless political quest?</p><p>The quick answer is that he has nothing to lose. Under the Virginia Constitution, no governor can succeed himself, a rare prohibition in state politics. Beyond that, Wilder no doubt hopes to emerge from the nominating season if not with the nomination itself, then at least with some national clout in his own party, specifically as the pre-eminent power broker of black votes. Should Wilder succeed in becoming even a partial heir to Jesse Jackson's constituency, he could be in position for another Presidential bid in 1996 or, alternatively, for a run in 1994 or 1996 at one of Virginia's Senate seats.</p><p>Then there is the possibility, often bruited about in political circles, that Wilder is really after a spot on the 1992 ticket as the Vice Presidential nominee. Though few give this much chance of happening, Wilder's supporters are forever toying aloud with this idea, arguing that their candidate could bring much-needed ideological and racial balance to the Democratic ticket.</p><p>"People who sell a possibility like this short do it at their own risk," warns Paul Goldman, the tart ex-New Yorker who is chairman of Virginia's Democratic Party and has been the Governor's chief political schemer and dreamer since 1984. "Wilder is the most underestimated politician in America today."</p><p>Though Wilder insists his sole goal is the Presidency, more likely he is simply seeing how far he can take his candidacy. His philosophy of public life, he has often said, is to "get a little bit today and come back for the rest tomorrow."</p><p>WILDER HAS BEEN DAMAGED by the growing perception that he is prone to sudden about-faces on issues and to displays of temper with friends and foes alike.</p><p>"Well, these are things I have to deal with," he admits. "They are perceptions that don't help."</p><p>The sharp edges of Wilder's personality were clearly on display one day last fall, when Jesse Jackson came to the Governor's mansion to discuss the 1992 campaign. At the top of Jackson's agenda was a complaint; a number of Virginia school districts had taken the Wilder administration to court in an effort to get more funds. Wilder was obviously irked by having to listen to a lecture from the man who remains perhaps the chief obstacle to his national political ambitions.</p><p>After conferring in private for about an hour, the two men emerged from the mansion and walked over to a clutch of waiting reporters and television cameras. Wilder, his arm around Jackson's shoulder, spoke glowingly of his rival.</p><p>"And, oh, yes, Jesse," Wilder concluded abruptly, his tone changing. "Don't come down here again talking about schools unless you bring money."</p><p>Jackson took a half-step back, struggling to crack a smile. Wilder then turned his back on Jackson and began to chat with bystanders, leaving his rival to make an unceremonious exit.</p><p>This is the way Wilder plays the political game. Courteous as he customarily is, he comes at those who cross him, or those he believes have crossed him, with a quick vengeance, political fist balled.</p><p>Last spring, his longtime feud with Senator Charles S. Robb, his major Democratic rival in Virginia, bubbled up again in the open, becoming so rancorous it made news from coast to coast. Party leaders in and out of the state warned that both men risked their political futures if they continued to squabble like petulant children over the Governor's charge that the Senator had tapped his phone and the Senator's countercharge that the Governor had ordered a police investigation of his private life. But the animosity between Wilder and Robb is virtually certain to flare up again. There is little political or personal chemistry between the two, and in the background lurks the possibility that Wilder will challenge Robb for his Senate seat two years from now.</p><p>Wilder also came off less than well in the surprise departure of his press secretary of the last two years, Laura Dillard. Asked to explain what happened, the Governor initially refused to comment. Meanwhile, several Wilder aides began calling reporters around the state, suggesting that Dillard had been forced to leave over a series of anti-Semitic and anti-black remarks. But later, investigations by several Virginia newspapers revealed that Dillard's sin had been to dare question whether Wilder ought to be running for President before completing his term as Governor.</p><p>"You can be with Doug 99 times in a row, but if you're against him the 100th time, he'll say, 'He was never with me,' " the Governor's chief of staff, J. T. Shropshire, once said. In spite of this oft-repeated observation, Shropshire has not lost his position.</p><p>Wilder's contentiousness comes through even in everyday conversation. He sees all politics -- and most of life -- as a bruising contact sport. "Let me tell you why Jesse Jackson has been such a success," he says. "Jesse makes people cower politically. I don't blame him."</p><p>From the start, Wilder's basic campaign theme has been that the Democrats will never recapture the Presidency until they stop nominating liberal tax-and-spend candidates. Instead, he argues, the party must put a new kind of politician on the national stage, a realist who blends social compassion with balanced budgets -- not by raising taxes, but by eliminating "niceties" in favor of "necessities." That's the way, Wilder boasts, he has always run and won in Virginia.</p><p>But lately the Governor has begun to shift more than a little on the tax issue. "I wouldn't automatically veto a tax increase in Virginia," he now says. "But it would have to be bipartisan."</p><p>Wilder, however, has pinned his Presidential hopes on the claim that he successfully balanced Virginia's budget without raising taxes. Does this mean he is now backing off?</p><p>"Not at all, not at all," he insists. "It would be irresponsible to flatly rule out any increase, especially one with bipartisan support."</p><p>Then he chuckles. "Clever, though," he says, slapping his knee for effect. "Damn clever way to handle those Republicans."</p><p>WILDER GREW UP IN A LARGE, deeply religious Baptist family. His father, Robert, was an insurance salesman and his mother, Beulah, worked as a maid. The second-youngest of eight children, he put himself through the predominantly black Virginia Union University in Richmond, won a Bronze Star as an infantryman in the Korean War, and under the G.I. bill went through Howard University Law School in Washington. While in law school, he married a Howard undergraduate, Eunice Montgomery. Before divorcing in 1978, the couple had three children: two daughters, Lynn, 32, and Loren, 28, and a son, Lawrence Jr., 29.</p><p>It might come as a surprise to Wilder-watchers today that in his political youth, he positioned himself as a liberal, and a confrontational one at that. After entering the State Senate, he began to sport a bushy Afro and to press demands for fair-housing legislation, more minority hiring in business and making the death penalty unconstitutional. In his maiden speech, he charged that the state of Virginia, including its Legislature, was racist to the core, and called heretically for dropping the official state song, "Carry Me Back to Old Virginia," which contained the words "massah" and "darkie."</p><p>Wilder made little progress on his demands, and his career seemed headed in the same direction. But then he abruptly changed course. He became one of the Legislature's great compromisers, a man who would drop a demand here to gain a concession there, who would do a favor to get a favor. Thereafter, he ascended steadily through the ranks of the Senate, eventually becoming chairman of the powerful committee that oversees state appointments. In 1984, when he could not persuade his fellow senators to designate a holiday in memory of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., he engineered the ultimate compromise: he persuaded them to set aside a day on which Dr. King would be remembered -- the same day that honored Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson.</p><p>Wilder's strong suit has always been his ability to take the political pulse of the electorate, rather than the everyday details of governing. His speeches are packed not with facts and specific proposals but with symbolically charged rhetoric, telling vignettes and sharp digs -- the mention of David Duke and George Bush in the same sentence, the heart-tugging tale of a sick child who died because her poor family could not afford health care, the flat promise that in the first few weeks of his Presidency he will eliminate $50 billion in Government programs, military spending and bureaucratic waste.</p><p>"He's positioning and repositioning himself all the time," says Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist who has followed the Governor's career closely. "My guess is that by the end of this campaign, he'll try to be the broker of the black vote, which would give him the kind of clout Jesse had. He'll demand that the party not ignore him, because he's the only black candidate in a party that has to have the black vote to win. That's his kind of positioning. He may not pull it off. But you'll hear the noise."</p><p>In the 1989 gubernatorial race in Virginia, Wilder won by putting together an unusual coalition of black and middle-class white voters. Running against J. Marshall Coleman, a Republican former state attorney general, Wilder managed, in a single ideological mouthful, to support, among other things, both abortion rights and the death penalty (he'd flip-flopped on that issue since his early State Senate days). His abortion-rights stand proved critical, drawing big support from women and those in the state's heavily liberal Washington suburbs, and enabled him to squeeze out a 0.3 percent margin of victory.</p><p>The Governor says he intends to replicate that election feat nationally, that he can assemble the same coalition from coast to coast. "If it can happen in Virginia," he argues, "it can happen anywhere."</p><p>Increasingly in his Presidential campaign, however, Wilder appears to be concentrating less on putting together a black-white coalition than on an all-out pursuit of black voters. He has hired some of Jackson's former aides -- among them Joe Johnson, a top Jackson operative who has become Wilder's campaign manager -- and his speeches contain ever more criticisms of President Bush's handling of civil rights issues. "The Bush Administration's resistance to strong civil rights measures helps produce the David Dukes," he says.</p><p>Meanwhile, black politiciansaround the country have adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Mayor W. Wilson Goode of Philadelphia is typical. "If Doug delivers the message," he says, "he'll get the vote."</p><p>While Jesse Jackson's aides are urging black officials to withhold their commitments until the race is further along, Jackson himself will say only that if "the Honorable Governor of Virginia" expects to inherit the votes of his Rainbow Coalition, he will have to "earn them the old-fashioned way, by working for them."</p><p>IN 1984, WHEN DOUG WILDER announced his candidacy for Lieutenant Governor, he stood in the State Capitol beneath a large oil portrait of Harry F. Byrd Sr., the former United States Senator whose name is virtually synonymous with old-style Southern segregation. That gesture would have been impossible for many blacks in politics, but for Wilder it was just part of the process. Coming from a senate district that was predominantly black, Wilder knew that to win a statewide office in Virginia he would need to reach out for white votes, and there was no more revered political figure in the Old Dominion than Byrd, who led the "massive resistance," Virginia's abortive struggle against desegregation in the 50's.</p><p>But Wilder did not stop there. Later in the campaign, he permitted himself to be photographed in front of Confederate flags and ran a television ad in which a burly white rural sheriff endorsed him. But when backers of his Republican opponent, State Senator John H. Chichester, tried to tag him as a liberal, Wilder played the other side of the race card. "That's a code word for racism," he declared.</p><p>Wilder was never a major figure in the civil rights movement. In the 60's, when many of his peers were in the streets demonstrating for racial equality, he was focusing his energies on building a career in law, primarily as a defense attorney and the founder of his own firm, and later a career in politics. "During the days of the movement, I figured I could be more effective behind the scenes than up on the barricades," Wilder explains. "I worked on making myself the best lawyer and politician possible on the theory that I could best serve not by being a demonstrator in handcuffs but by seeking to get the handcuffs off the demonstrator and the repressive laws changed. I have no second thoughts about that."</p><p>And there is no denying the historic achievement of his successful campaigns in Virginia, where no black had held high elective office for more than a century.</p><p>For all of his triumphs in Virginia politics, however, Wilder has amassed an unusually wide array of enemies and detractors within the state. His feuds and switchbacks, his decision to run for President in Virginia's hour of economic need and, yes, the fact that as a divorced man for almost 15 years, he sometimes dates white women, among them Patricia Kluge, the former wife of the billionaire John Kluge -- all have pushed down his statewide approval rating to an embarrassing 23 percent in mid-December, the lowest figure for a Virginia governor in history.</p><p>"Those of us who've dealt with him can tell people around the country that Doug Wilder is not always a nice man," says Steve Haner, the director of the Republican caucus in the Virginia Legislature. "In last fall's state elections, our candidates ran as much against him as their real opponents, and we made the biggest gains in a century. How's he going to explain that?"</p><p>Wilder's answer: "Incumbents were the targets of voter discontent, and that discontent can be blamed on the Bush Administration."</p><p>ON A RAW DECEMBER DAY, Wilder has come to the State Capitol at Concord, N.H., braving 10-degree temperatures to hand the New Hampshire Secretary of State a check for $1,000, the entry fee for the Feb. 18 primary. The dozen reporters on hand to chronicle the moment want to know -- given the Governor's low standing in the polls and equally low standing on the fund-raising front -- whether Wilder is serious about his candidacy. Does he really have a shot, or is he angling for the Vice Presidential spot?</p><p>But all the reporters get is another recitation of the mantra. "I tell you I expect to be elected President of the United States," Wilder says.</p><p>Outside the filing office, the Governor bumps into an old acquaintance, Eugene J. McCarthy, the former Senator from Minnesota. Back in 1968, McCarthy ran a legendary race in the New Hampshire primary against the Vietnam War and all but destroyed Lyndon Johnson's hopes for re-election. Now McCarthy makes the Presidential run nearly every four years, evidently just for the nostalgia of it.</p><p>"Doug," McCarthy says, grasping the Governor's hand. "All you have to do is beat the spread."</p><p>Wilder gives out a hearty laugh. He likes the spread in New Hampshire, where the morning line has him as the biggest long shot in the race -- sixth in a field of six. To beat it, he figures, all he has to do is run better than only one of his opponents.</p><p>"I'm dead serious about staying in this race," Wilder declares, as he exits the Capitol building. "But if I don't do well in the Southern primaries, it's all over for me."</p><p>But after watching the Governor on the campaign trail for several months, most Democratic officials remain skeptical. "He's relying too much on generalities about what he's done in the past and not offering enough vision for the future," says George Bruno, a Democratic National Committeeman from New Hampshire who has aligned himself with Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas. "It's hard to figure out what he really stands for. He was one of the first to announce his candidacy, but he's been slow getting his team on the ground, slow winning commitments. He'd better keep in mind that he's running for President, not Governor."</p><p>Wilder himself may be starting to realize how different politics is in the national arena. Near the end of his news conference at the Four Seasons Hotel, he appeared to hedge his promise to fight to the end, and he gave himself a possible out. Almost as an aside, he allowed that if the economic situation in Virginia continued to get worse, requiring more of his attention, he might be forced to reassess whether to continue his candidacy.</p><p>But a few hours later, during a campaign appearance at a black church center, the old Wilder bluster was back. Looking directly into a television news camera, he proclaimed, his voice keening with confidence: "I am a lion. The slaughterhouse of failure is not my destiny."</p><!-- Module ends: a-body-after-first-para--></div><div id="mod-contributor" style="" class="mod-nytimescontributor"><!-- Module starts: contributor (Contributor) -->B.
