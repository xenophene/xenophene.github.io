### ... that might actually be good for you ###

Note: Everything below are things I've learnt from Coach Arunim.

Before we continue, let's understand the fundamental unit of nutrition: calorie. A calorie has two aspects: 1) quantitative i.e. the net calorie count ingested in a period of time, and 2) qualitative i.e. where (proteins, fats, carbs, etc) those calories come from. No nutrition routine is ideal. It depends on you and you depend on your environment. So it is dynamic and requires you to constantly experiment. Luckily, experimentation also raises self-awareness. So here goes.

#### Cut out added sugar ####
No, really, just cut it out. No more tearing off those rectangular paper packets, no matter their color. See sugar sprinkled on top of something (donuts, pancakes, french toast)? Just say no. If you're really craving sugar, eat an apple. Sounds gross? Good, we're just getting started.
Cut down on dairy
Apparently 70% of the Indian population is lactose intolerant, and we are still the largest dairy consumer in the world. Ironic? Dairy (creamers, ice cream, shakes) often just hangs around in a meal to provide that liquidy sugarness, we don't need it. The only exception is paneer which is yummmmy (peeli paneer aka chaman is a staple in kashmiri cuisine üòç). 

#### Cut down on grains ####
Grains (rice, wheat) were a technology marvel when they were discovered some 10,000 years ago. They helped humanity diversify away from having to hunt animals or forage for berries. They are great for people with a very active lifestyle. For the rest of us, a more optimal source of carbohydrates are vegetables and fruits.

#### Cultivate a taste of rawness #### 
Have you ever had the peel of an apple? How about a mango? A kiwi? How about a raw celery? Try it. None of it kills you and you get essential fibers instead.

#### Vaccinate against trigger foods #### 
We all have "trigger foods''. Nutella, peanut butter, bread, cheerios, choco puffs, donuts, bagels! One look and you're in a state of flow gorging on the deliciousness. Experts advise to just avoid having these foods within reach. But, this kind of denial is only setting you up for an epic binge bash. Instead, try to eat these foods slowly and in small quantities. In the first few bites, you are already over the "hype" and don't want it anymore.

#### Texture your foods #### 
Break foods down to their elements: the taste comes from spices, the crunchiness comes from preparation, etc. Many times when you're craving fries, you're just craving salty crunchiness: add flax/hemp seeds.

#### Throw excess food (or take less) #### 
As Coach Arunim says, when faced with a choice to throw the excess food in your body or in the trash, the choice should be clear. Don't treat your body worse than trash. Don't waste food either: take smaller portions, save for later or give it away.

#### Watch mukbangs #### 
Mukbangs are a weird subculture on YouTube where people stream themselves eating a lot of food ([and I mean a lot](https://youtu.be/YmabxZ83SyU)). Interestingly, you can watch those videos while gulping down an innocent smoothie. Your brain now thinks you just had every pizza made by Dominos.

#### Track macros till your brain fries #### 
Spend a few days learning to read nutrition labels! At the very least, know the amount of the big 3 macros (fats, carbs, proteins) in whatever you're eating. Add up all the macro triplets consumed during the day. It would feel like having to solve a third order partial differential equation in 3 variables just to eat a slice of bread, but it's worth it in the long run.

#### Fast #### 
How do you lose body weight? Be in a caloric deficit. How? Just. Don't. Eat. This is the way. Strange, fascinating, amazing, unbelievable things happen to your body when you go on 4, 8, 16, 24, 48 hour fasts. Remember to take care of yourself! Starting your day with black coffee and having the first meal around noon can get you in a 14-16 hour fasting window. Use fasting as a way to completely reset your digestive processes and start afresh.
