Oh wow yet another year going by (why am I surprised, time doesn't wait for anyone!)
I literally had 0 blog entries in 2019 (if you don't count the major edit I did to the financial planning blog), so I am
sneaking in this quick one to fix that.
2019 was full of highlights and travel but the last month really topped it off. I went to India (third time this year, my
personal record). While the stay itself was fun as always, the journey was especially memorable. A day spend each way in
Hong Kong flying in Cathay Pacific! The first time I flew Cathay was for taking interviews at Google Bangalore and was on
Premium Economy. I was completely blown away by the fancy aircraft and so this time when I had an opportunity to fly *business*
I was ecstatic. I booked the trip on AA.com using 140k AA points. You can look into earning AA points by opening Citi
AAdvantage cards (reach out to me if you have questions, I love talking points!).

So on to the fun stuff!

During the trip, I explored 3 Cathay lounges: one at SFO and two at HKG. I visited the Bridge and the Pier lounges at HKG
and neither disappointed! These lounges offer a host of amenities like
* shower
* noodle bar
* alcohol & hot meals
* tea lounge
* pizza and other baked goodies
* WiFi and meditation and sleeping areas
Here are some pictures from the lounge

All four flights (SFO -> HKG -> DEL -> HKG -> SFO) were a dream! Here are some pictures

Hong Kong itself did not disappoint! Such a beautiful city with so much to see and eat!

On my return trip, I used 5 means of transport on the same day: flight, taxi, bus, train and ferry! And celebrated Christmas
2019 in 3 cities: Delhi, Hong Kong and San Francisco!

On to 2020 and more such experiences! Seriously, everyone reading this, should look into travel hacking, it's worth it!
