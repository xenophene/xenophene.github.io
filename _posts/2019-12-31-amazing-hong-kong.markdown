Oh wow yet another year going by (why am I surprised, time doesn't wait for anyone!)
I literally had 0 blog entries in 2019 (if you don't count the major edit I did to the financial planning blog), so I am
sneaking in this quick one to fix that.
2019 was full of highlights and travel but the last month really topped it off. I went to India (third time this year, my
personal record). While the stay itself was fun as always, the journey was especially memorable. A day spend each way in
Hong Kong flying in Cathay Pacific! The first time I flew Cathay was for taking interviews at Google Bangalore and was on
Premium Economy. I was completely blown away by the fancy aircraft and so this time when I had an opportunity to fly *business*
I was ecstatic. I booked the trip on AA.com using 140k AA points. You can look into earning AA points by opening Citi
AAdvantage cards (reach out to me if you have questions, I love talking points!).

So on to the fun stuff!

The journey started in SFO Cathay lounge where I was 4 hours early for my flight, and boy was that the right choice. The lounge
is located tucked away in a narrow hallway with not such a grand entrace but the appearances can be deceiving! The lounge
opens up and has a host of amenities like
* shower
* noodle bar
* alcohol & hot meals
* WiFi and comfortable couches
Here are some pictures from the lounge
