2020 gave me a lot of time to introspect. Here are 8 things that I consider while
deciding what business should or shouldn't be part of my portfolio.

Note: I would strongly suggest you read my [financial planning](http://xenophene.github.io/finance/2018/01/25/hands-of-financial-planning.html)
article as well as I am a strong advocate of passive index investing over active stock picking!

~~Long~~ Indefinite-term investments
The best businesses arenâ€™t just compounding machines, they produce compounding machines. Such businesses 1) clearly articulate their mission, 2) are decades away from achieving that vision, and 3) have the necessary ingredients in fulfilling their destiny. These mission-driven businesses must be held for indefinitely-long time periods as they are timeless. Square works on enabling finance for everyone. Tesla works on accelerating the advent of sustainable energy.
