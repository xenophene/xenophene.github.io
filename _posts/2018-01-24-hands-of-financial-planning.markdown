Human Emotion is a powerful force. The reason it is such a powerful and core element of the human psyche is that it helps us to
make _decisions_. Not necessarily _good_ or _rational_ decisions, but decisions nonetheless. It helps us get past the forks in the
road. Our emotions are able to make these decisions for us essentially because they encode and intricately tie together our life experiences,
biases, likes and dislikes. Now, emotion can work out brilliantly for some. But, consistenly relying on one's emotions to make decisions can very
quickly derail into something akin to playing a lottery. Even if you win, you know you can't explain it, let alone repeat the process.
And one of the last things you want to do is to use all your hard-earned money to buy lottery tickets.

Which brings us to the daunting subject of financial planning. And one strategy to systematically eliminate emotion from it. This strategy is
exceedingly simple by design. It is clearly not the cleverest thing you can do, but again cleverness is emotion wearing a top hat.
As we go through the strategy, keep in mind, the concept of _net worth_ which we will keep alluding to. It is basically the worth of everything you own.
We will use N to denote it.

The strategy is to have plans of action for a variety of time horizons. 1 day, 6 months, 3 years, 10 years, and on and on. The time horizon is the duration
within which you need the money that you are planning for. It essentially constrains what you can do with that money. Hence, each time horizon has
a very specific plan of action. Below I present the plans for the various time horizons. These may not align perfectly with you and your life goals. But
the idea is to get you to think of how you could adopt and adapt such a meta-plan.

### 1 day
We're basically talking about who's paying for your dinner tonight. The you from many months ago has hopefully already made this a simple choice for the
you today. Tip: Always keep some cash for urgent situations. Still, prefer using credit cards for their rewards.

### 6 months
Time for today's you to pay it forward. You have to budget for your expenses in the next 6 months. Ask yourself, how much rent do you pay
every month? How much do you spend on your daily means? The transportation costs? Let's say this number is X. That means if you cut all income streams today,
it will take 6 whole months for you to drain X. See what % of N is X. Is it more than 100%? Ouch, that means you really got to save much more than you
do today or make more than you do. Hustle! Basically, stop reading until 2 things happen: 1) you save X in a checking/savings account, and X drops to <20%
of N.

### 1 year
If you are reading this, I'm assuming N is now at least 5X. Good job! Uptil now, all of N was a _store of value_. You didn't expect
it to grow over time. All you expected from it was that it kept pace with inflation (i.e. if N could buy you 10 packets of Lays today,
it will buy you 10 packets in 2040). So, what do you do with 4X (N after leaving out the emergency fund)?
From here on, you have to think of 2 additional dimensions which stack together: tax and risk-adjusted-return. Simply put, money can either be in a
"tax-advantaged account" (401k, Roth, 529 being a few examples) or a regular account. While being in the either account, it could be invested into one or more of
a variety of investments, each somewhere on a risk-adjusted-return spectrum.
The 3 most common investments are
* Money market funds (aka Savings account, hello old friend, [VMMXX](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0030&FundIntExt=INT))
* Bonds (low risk, low return, [VBMFX](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/FundsSnapshot?FundId=0084&FundIntExt=INT))
* Stocks (high risk, high return, [VTSMX](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0085&FundIntExt=INT), [VGTSX](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0113&FundIntExt=INT))

Regarding the tax dimension, in almost all cases, prefer to fill up tax-advantaged space whenever possible and then spill over to after-tax space.
The amount that you may choose to invest for 1 year (remember the time horizon of 1 year means you decided you don't need this money for 1 year)
may depend greatly on your personal situation. But mathematically, the money you have is 4X (one-time) and I-E (monthly income minus expenditure) every month.
If you are just starting out, you can simply pick a fraction say 0.5, and equally divide 0.5\*(I-E), contributing into VMMXX, VBMFX, VTSMX and VGTSX every month.
As you learn more about this space, feel free to adjust these fractions.

### 1 - 3 years and beyond
Things are getting really interesting now! If you are thinking this long term, you have a stable job that's making you more than you need right now and even
for a year. That's great news. So where does this new money go? If things are going as planned, X should be 5-10% of N by now. All the difference is in a
combination of the funds outlined above, completely filling out the tax-advantaged space. As you move to plan for the longer time horizons, it is important to realize
2 concepts: 1) power of compounding, 2) strength of human productivity and innovation. If you just Google examples of how compounding returns can work in your
favor, you will be amazed. The more time you let an investment compound, the more non-linear and delightful it is! This is where the second point comes in.
By buying companies, specially companies that are innovative in a competitive environment, you can reap the benefits of millions of humans (company employees) putting
their minds together to find newer and more efficient ways of doing things. The benefits reach you in the form of appreciated stock prices after multiple years
of holding the stock.
But which company will be the most dominant in 5 years? Will it be the same as the dominant one 15 years in to the future? Probably not. Wouldn't it be nice if you
_never_ had to take this call? Well, that's where index funds (the Vanguard funds above are all the index funds you'd typically need) come in. So you basically
keep buying more and more of US and International stock markets and capture part of the productivity gains made by the 10s of 1000s of companies in the world.

So, to recap the strategy, here are the key points
1. Find X which is your 6-month expenses.
2. If X is >20% of N, save, save and save.
3. Once X is <20% of N, start buying one of 4 Vanguard funds in order of their risk (VMMXX < VBMFX < VTSMX < VGTSX)
4. Depending on your risk profile, put some of the 4X out of N, and a lot of (I - E) every month.
5. Once X becomes 1-10% of N, you've already become financially savvy enough not to need such a list. But still, shift to riskier investments (still stock though)
6. X is now ~1% of N, ~5% of N in bonds, 40% of N in US stocks, 40% of N in International stocks, 5% of N in cash/checking accounts, some stock picking for fun, and the rest in Bitcoin (why not?).

There you have it. Note that you can potentially do all of 1-6 today, depending on what X and N is for you. But it's more about the journey and you enjoying it.
Best wishes!
