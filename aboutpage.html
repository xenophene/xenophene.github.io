    <h2>About This Page</h2>
    
    <!--
    <p>
    If you are here, it means you were slightly curious as to how this page was thought about, which means I've been partly successful in my job of designing this page, and that I should now end this already abnormally long sentence which had stopped making any sense as soon as it started to banter about itself which is one quality that we all as humans should learn to imbibe.
    </p>
    <p>
    So! This page, like most of the things around us, has been made possible at a <em>very</em> high level due to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion" target="_blank"><em>Recursion</em></a>.
    In particular, I have used the idea of Bootstrapping, and -->
    <p>
    Credits for this site go (in no particular order) to Alan Turing, Tim Burners-Lee, Google, CSE@IIT Delhi, Leonhard Euler, Mark Otto & Jacob Thornton (Bootstrap). The (amazing) bootstrap library is found <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/" target="_blank">here</a>.

    <h4>Note to self:</h4>
    <p>
    The web is about continuous iteration and hacking, and unless one uses a framework, building from scratch with custom CSS and Javascript is just not feasible or even desirable. 
    <!--As a hacker once said
    <blockquote>
      <p>Hackers never finish a program. As soon as they achieve what they originally set out for, they take it further and keep at it. </p>

    However, in order to appreciate the many different building blocks, one needs to get into atleast a few of them, to see how they work, even try to build them. Remember, however fancy the tool looks, it is built from simple Javascript & CSS. Here are some valuable resources to get started.

        <dd>Places like <a href="http://www.quora.com/Web-Development/best_questions" target="_blank">Quora resource on Web Coding</a> and posts like <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/30-html-best-practices-for-beginners/" target="_blank">this</a> are golden.

        <dd>A good way to soak in web code is to just keep looking at it! Just right click on any page, select Inspect Element and viol&agrave;. This is a good way to learn about confusing attributes like <tt>padding</tt>, <tt>margins</tt>, etc. There are many other tools like Web Inspector that help. The best part about web development is that you can get your ideas ready and running beautifully in a <em>jiffy</em>.</dd>

        <dd>I love this word because it sounds like a great philosiphical theory (it probably IS) that I can never hope to understand. But related to web designing, it is probably the best way to describe Google & Apple's mantra in one word. Think of only the most important things first and then build iteratively. <a href="https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/376541_195567407198916_192917177463939_404616_1963486470_n.jpg" target="_blank">This</a> is a funny reference.</dd>
