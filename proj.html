            We are working on a system to effectively visualize the time evolution of a news corpus. We want to make the news browsing experience extremely intuitive and contextual for an end-user. We have tried various approaches, and have reached some interesting conclusions. At this stage, we are building an interface based on our experiences and inferences of what should make a good news browsing experience. The data set of articles we have used have been New York Times articles(<a href="//nytimes.com" target="_blank">[5]</a>) from 1987 to 2007, as well articles from The Hindu(<a href="//thehindu.com" target="_blank">[6]</a>). For extracting entities (person, organization, topics, etc), we have experimented with various tools like OpenCalais(<a href="//opencalais.com" target="_blank">[2]</a>), Stanford NER(<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CDAQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fnlp.stanford.edu%2Fsoftware%2FCRF-NER.shtml&ei=Dx_LUK6WD4jWrQek2YGIAQ&usg=AFQjCNENbNmwtXhxEAdBwHrWsA_NeD9hWg&bvm=bv.1355325884,d.bmk" target="_blank">[3]</a>), Alchemy API(<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CDAQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alchemyapi.com%2Fapi%2Fentity%2F&ei=Mh_LULbNHobnrAegvoDgAg&usg=AFQjCNEZWiRxdtINqxVpxUXBdAosJz-gOA&bvm=bv.1355325884,d.bmk" target="_blank">[4]</a>) and have found that OpenCalais works best for a range of entities. 
            <br>The work has the following broad themes involved, which have been explored separately.
              <ul>
                <li class="strong">News representation as a Directed Graph</li>
                <li class="left">
                  The primary reference for our work has been <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&ved=0CDcQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fciteseerx.ist.psu.edu%2Fviewdoc%2Fsummary%3Fdoi%3D10.1.1.133.282&ei=ExnLUO7BJ4yGrAeQuIC4BQ&usg=AFQjCNGU6vuxUzfI10krM1iMkvBomifS1w&bvm=bv.1355325884,d.bmk">[1]</a>. We can think of news articles as nodes of a directed graph, which are arranged sequentially in time. There are links between articles based on the transformations that common "actors" undergo between these articles. There are 5 types of interactions defined between any 2 actors.
                  <dl class="dl-horizontal">
                    <dt>Birth</dt><dd>First occurrence of an actor in the recent past</dd>
                    <dt>Cease</dt><dd>Last occurence of an actor in the near future</dd>
                    <dt>Merge</dt><dd>First co-occurence of 2 actors in the recent past</dd>
                    <dt>Split</dt><dd>Last co-occurence of 2 actors in the near future</dd>
                    <dt>Continue</dt><dd>Continued co-occurrence of 2 actors, having co-occurred in the past and future</dd>
                  </dl>
                  The overall algorithm is to take in a set of articles, mine entities from them and then find and score all the different transformations among these entities. There on, we generate a graph with nodes as the articles labeled by the entities in the article, and the smallest possible edge set which covers all these transformations. We implemented this algorithm to run on NYTimes articles from 2000. Some graphs can be seen <a href="graphs/index_jan.html" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="graphs/index_jan_feb.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Some interaction graphs between dominant actors involved in US Elections 2000 can be found <a href="graphs/newscode/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
                  <strong>Observations</strong>: The directed graph, as you can see from the examples, becomes too densely connected and is very sensitive to the actor quality. Additionally, the emphasis is still on the nodes i.e. the articles, and the user is expected to navigate through each and get a sense of the story. Some more observations have been summarized in <a href="IS_presentation_ravee.pdf">this</a> report.
                </li>
                <li class="strong">News representation as topic-actor interaction map</li>
                <li class="left">
                  We are currently working on an interface to visualize news as a sequence of interactions among
                  mined topics and actors, using the graph as a back-end alongside other scoring techniques.
                  For this, we have designed a survey available <a href="http://konfrap.com/esthete/">here</a>.

                We considered the problem of image flattening of the Cortical Surface of the Human Brain. Images of the Brain are acquired through MRI (Structural and Functional) scans, which operates on the principle of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance" target="_blank">Nuclear Magnetic Resonance</a>. <br><br>
                The output is a 3D image of the brain, which is analyzed as slices of 2D images. However, since the surface of the brain is highly convoluted, this distorts distance between two points on the surface and makes it difficult to see the tumours that lie deep in a Sulcus(depression). Our approach was to think of the flattening as a mapping from a 3D surface to a 2D plane, preserving neighbourhood topology and minimizing surface distortion.

The correlation measure gives an insight into how fundamental the Indian market is. The sectors we considered were Banking, Oil, FMCG and Automobile. This idea was an extension of the work above to the Indian market. A report can be found <a href="ReportFinal.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Our conclusion was that even though there is a huge frequency difference between stock price change and company ratios, there still is a <em>general correlation</em> between them.</li>

              We conducted a study to measure how web Search Expertise (SE) and Domain Expertise (DE) affects the overall search performance and
              search behavior of a user on domain specific search tasks. Search performance is a measure of how fast a user is able to arrive
              at an accurate answer for a given fact finding search tasks. Domain Expertise is a measure of the knowledge of the user
              in the domain from which the online search task was created.

            <li><span class="heading">Clustering Questions using their Answers : Sachindra Joshi, IBM IRL</span><br/>
              Our problem was to aggregate related questions asked on multiple forums and create a holistic FAQ/Question repository. This helps in deduplicating similar questions and answering them if a related question was already answered elsewhere.
              However, tf-idf text clustering performs poorly when the text is in the form of questions, chiefly because questions are usually brief. For eg., <em>How do I activate this product?</em> and <em>How do I obtain a license key?</em> would have similar answers, but have poor word overlap. However, if we had access to their answers we can learn that questions like this are very similar.
              We implemented a clustering algorithm which used the information in the answers domain to guide and improve the clustering of the question. The idea was inspired from <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5360229&tag=1" target="_blank">[1]</a>.
