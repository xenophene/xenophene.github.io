The number of patents filed in the US by our engineers in India is perhaps the highest from any technology company in the country. Dataquest and the Government of India have recognized TI as the most innovative company in the country.\r<br /> <br />TI India has achieved many firsts in its impressive track record. In 1995, TI developed the first processor designed in India for control applications. The TI India R&amp;D Center was extensively involved in developing LoCosto, the industrys first single chip solution for wireless handsets.\r<br />The National Association for Software & Services Companies (NASSCOM) conferred TI with the NASSCOM Award for IT Innovation for 2007.\r<br /> <br />TI India is deeply involved in developing state-of-the-art solutions for applications like wireless handsets, wireless infrastructure (base stations), video (security and surveillance, IP phones, set-top boxes), High Performance Analog, etc. Today, there is hardly any chip produced by TI that is not touched by engineers at TI India.Since 2006, in addition to being a significant and critical R&amp;D center for TI globally, TI India has increased its focus on the Indian semiconductor market in a big way. The company is working closely with its customers in India in a wide array of sectors such as industrial electronics (UPS, inverters, energy meters, lighting, etc.), medical electronics (ultrasound scanners, x-ray machines, ECG machines, MRI scanners, etc.), consumer, telecom and automotive. TI India has opened offices in multiple locations in the country to reach out to its customers with sales and applications support.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"last\" colspan=\"2\">\u00a0</td>\n</tr>\n</table><table class=\"jnf\">\n<tr>\n<td class=\"head\" colspan=\"2\">JOB PROFILE</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"normal\">Job Designation :</td>\n<td>\n\t\tDesign Engineer - Analog\n\t\t</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"normal\" style=\"vertical-align:top\">Job Description :</td>\n<td>\n\t\t: Part of the team that is chartered to develop state-of-the art high performance analog products that have unique differentiation . \r<br />Strong analog basics and passion for analog.
