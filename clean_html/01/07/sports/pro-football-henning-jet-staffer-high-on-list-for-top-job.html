<p><strong></strong>If Bill Parcells does what he promised again today -- find someone else to coach the Jets -- he will very likely look at his own staff first to see who can succeed him.</p><p>And while he has been with all the other coaches on his staff longer in the National Football League, the one he knows best is the short-timer -- the quarterbacks coach Dan Henning. The 57-year-old, gray-haired, wisecracking Henning is the only Jets assistant with head coaching experience in the N.F.L. He had two unfortunate stints -- at Atlanta and at San Diego. Parcells, his good friend, blames bad management and ownership.</p><p>Henning's Atlanta teams were 22-41-1 from 1983-86, and his Chargers teams posted a 16-32 mark from 1989-91.</p><p>Parcells is also very likely to consider Al Groh, the linebackers coach and his former defensive coordinator for four years at New England. Groh is one of two assistants to whom Parcells has given a so-called ''supervisory'' tag -- if another club wants him, that club would have to offer him the head coach's spot. The other supervisor label is on the offensive coordinator Charlie Weis, who has one year remaining on his contract.</p><p>But Henning goes back with Parcells to 1969. Then they teamed up together as Florida State assistants in 1970. Parcells describes their similar backgrounds -- Henning was a three-sport star at St. Francis Prep in Brooklyn at the same time Parcells was making a name for himself in basketball, football and baseball at River Dell (N.J.) High.</p><p>Parcells tapped Henning to take over the Jets' quarterbacks in 1998. At the time, Neil O'Donnell was the incumbent, Glenn Foley was the hopeful and a special teams player named Ray Lucas was going to get his chance to see if he could throw in the big leagues.</p><p>By season's end, a revamped free agent, Vinny Testaverde, was leading the Jets to the American Conference championship. And this season, Lucas took over in midseason after a faltering performance from Rick Mirer, who had stepped in for a sidelined Testaverde. Lucas wound up with a 6-3 record.</p><p>Parcells has repeatedly praised Henning's work with Lucas.</p><p>''I talk to Ray about other things, but Dan is giving him the football knowledge,'' Parcells said.</p><p>This has not been Henning's first stint with the Jets. He joined them in 1976 as the quarterbacks' coach even though he was only one year older than Joe Namath. Henning helped groom Namath's successor, Richard Todd. Over the years, Henning also tutored Joe Theismann, Bob Griese, Jim McMahon and Steve Bartkowski.</p><p>Henning, who played at William and Mary, was the successful coach for a pair of Redskins Super Bowl victories -- capping the 1983 and 1988 seasons. The latter triumph was marked by Doug Williams's record-setting second quarter, when he threw four touchdowns against the Broncos. Henning also was the head coach at Boston College for three years, replacing Tom Coughlin. Parcells was with the Patriots then and the two resumed their friendship. Although Henning led the Eagles to an Aloha Bowl victory in his first season of 1994, he was fired after the 1996 season following a gambling scandal that came close to wrecking the school's football program. Henning denied either he or his coaches were aware of any gambling.</p><p>He then became the Bills' offensive coordinator for 1997 before Marv Levy retired and Henning was able to hook up with Parcells again.</p></body></html>
