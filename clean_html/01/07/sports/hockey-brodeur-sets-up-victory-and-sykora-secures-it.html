<p><strong></strong>The streaking Devils scored off a penalty shot, on a power play and into an empty net tonight as they ended their most successful trip of the season with a 6-3 victory over the Buffalo Sabres.</p><p>The victory extended the Devils' unbeaten run to seven games and gave them 7 of a possible 8 points on this four-game trip.</p><p>Petr Sykora secured the victory with his penalty shot with 5 minutes 20 seconds to play in the third period and the Devils ahead by 4-3. It was the first penalty shot of the season for the Devils, and it was awarded after a Buffalo player closed his glove on the puck during a scrum in the crease.</p><p>''I was really calm,'' Sykora said of his shot, which beat goaltender Dwayne Roloson and gave Sykora his 13th goal of the season. ''I was waiting for an opening and when he didn't give it to me I made my move.''</p><p>Despite the six-goal burst by the Devils, it was goaltender Martin Brodeur who was their best player. A number of his 25 saves came at critical times and kept the Devils in the game when the outcome was up for grabs. He was so good at baffling the Sabres that at times players were scratching their heads in disbelief.</p><p>''Marty helped us with huge saves again,'' said Bobby Holik, whose goal with 7:19 to go in the third period on a blistering shot from the left circle broke a 3-3 tie. ''He did it in Pittsburgh and he did it again tonight. We didn't play that well until the last period.''</p><p>Brodeur made his best saves in the second period, when the Devils allowed Buffalo to take 15 shots against him. His best save came on Michal Grocek from directly in front.</p><p>''There were times we were standing around,'' said Brodeur, whose record of 23-9-5 gives him the most victories in the league. ''This road trip was very big for us because we played teams in our conference.''</p><p>It seems that Devils Coach Robbie Ftorek's policy of sitting players out at unexpected times is paying off. Randy McKay was asked to sit out the overtime victory against Ottawa on Monday and scored the winning goal in the next game, in Pittsburgh on Wednesday night.</p><p>Denis Pederson was perplexed by his benching against Pittsburgh and responded tonight with his second goal of the season. Ftorek gave Pederson an extra dose of inspiration by making him an alternate captain for the game.</p><p>The Devils rallied from two deficits against the struggling Sabres, whose loss was their sixth in a row at Marine Midland Arena.</p><p>Denis Hamel, who was promoted by Buffalo earlier in the day from Rochester of the American Hockey League, delighted the crowd when he opened the scoring in his very first shift in the league. The goal came on a rebound after a shot by Aleksei Zhitnik, 2:09 into the game.</p><p>The Devils took the lead on Pederson's goal and Claude Lemieux's 13th of the season, both coming before the game was 6:47 old. Pederson's came on a rising shot at 3:22 and Lemieux's from the right side after a pass from the other side by Scott Gomez during the Devils' first manpower advantage in the game.</p><p>Buffalo tied the score at 2-2 with 10:13 left in the first period, when Brian Holzinger entered the zone with speed down the middle and beat Brodeur with a back-hander.</p><p>The Sabres regained the lead 7:08 after the first intermission when the rookie Maxim Afinogenov scored on a 4-on-4 situation. Afinogenov cut into the middle from the right side and beat Brodeur with a low shot to the far side for his 11th goal.</p><p>But the Devils tied the score again, with 1:55 left in the second period, when Patrik Elias leapt on a rebound from Sykora's shot for his 12th goal. Holik's 12th goal of the season broke the 3-3 tie in the next period and Sykora's penalty shot broke the game open, before Gomez scored into the net left vacant when Buffalo inserted a skater for its goaltender.</p><p>SLAP SHOTS</p><p>The goal on his first shift in the league made DENIS HAMEL the fifth player in Sabres history to accomplish the feat. . . . Defenseman BRAD BOMBARDIR and forwards VADIM SHARIFIJANOV and SERGEI BRYLIN were the healthy scratches for the Devils. . . . The Devils returned to New Jersey after the game to prepare for Saturday's visit by Phoenix.</p></body></html>
