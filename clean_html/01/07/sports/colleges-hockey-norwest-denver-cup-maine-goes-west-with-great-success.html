<p><strong></strong>There is plenty of hope for the future in Denver. And when Maine travels to the West, hope is the only consolation prize.</p><p>The Black Bears won their second consecutive Norwest Denver Cup this past Saturday with a 4-3 victory over the struggling Denver Pioneers, who are eighth in the 10-team Western Collegiate Hockey Association. Overlooking his team's overall record of 7-12-1, Pioneers Coach George Gwozdecky found something he could build on for the remainder of the W.C.H.A. season.</p><p>''We had Maine on their heels, as much as they had us on our heels,'' Gwozdecky told The Denver Rocky Mountain News.</p><p>After the Black Bears' Cory Larose, who was selected as the tournament's most valuable player, scored the first goal, the Pioneers tied the score at 1-1 on a goal by the junior Kelly Popadynetz. Tied with the No. 3-ranked team in the nation after one period, the Pioneers proceeded to watch as the wheels fell off in the second period.</p><p>Goals by Michael Schutte, Gray Shaneberger and Matthias Trattnig gave the Black Bears what they needed to win the tournament.</p><p>''When they scored, all of a sudden there was such a huge swing in momentum,'' Gwozdecky said. ''A month ago, who knows how we would have reacted to that?''</p><p>In this game, the Pioneers reacted with Popadynetz's second score and a goal by Mark Rycroft.</p><p>For Maine, which beat Colorado College by 4-3 to reach the final, the tournament was an opportunity to maintain its edge on defense. ''We played a pretty solid game,'' Coach Shawn Walsh said after the Colorado College game. ''We only let them have five shots in the third period.''</p><p>Maine, which is tied with Boston College and Northeastern for third place in Hockey East, is 13-2-3 over all.</p><p>BATTLE IN MICHIGAN</p><p>Michigan State had the Blackburn they needed to come away with the Great Lakes Invitational title with a 3-1 victory over Michigan last Thursday in Detroit.</p><p>The Spartans' Joe Blackburn, who shares the goaltending with Ryan Miller, made 37 saves and was selected to the all-tournament team. Joining him were his teammates Shawn Horcoff, a forward, and Mike Weaver, a defenseman.</p><p>Michigan, which contributed defenseman Dave Huntzicker and forward Mark Kosick to the all-tournament team, continues to play without goaltender Josh Blackburn, who was expected to carry the load for the Wolverines. Instead, he injured his left foot while moving a refrigerator at home on Oct. 9.</p><p>The loss of the sophomore goalie forced Coach Red Berenson to turn to Kevin O'Malley and L.J. Scarpace, who is ranked ninth in the nation with a 1.85 goals against average. That gives Berenson a reason to be optimistic as the Wolverines (15-6 over all) wait for the return of Josh Blackburn, who is not related to Joe, later this month.</p><p>''I feel great about the way our team competed,'' Berenson told The Associated Press after the game. ''I think they learned something from the game.''</p><p>The Spartans' Horcoff, who was named the most valuable player of the tournament, knows all he needs to about the rivalry.</p><p>''The Michigan-Michigan State games are pretty much on another level. Everyone seems to get a little more jacked up for those games,'' he told The Detroit Free Press. ''I love playing those games. Those are the games that last in your mind.''</p><p>And even if they do not stick in the minds of the Spartans (15-5), there always is another meeting on the schedule.</p><p>The Spartans and Wolverines, ranked fifth and sixth in the nation, battle for first place in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association on Saturday in East Lansing.</p><p>HOLIDAY WINNERS</p><p>Minnesota defeated Northern Michigan, 6-2, to win the Mariucci Classic and Providence beat Rensselaer, 5-3, for the Holiday Hockey tournament title in Troy, N.Y. Other champions include Connecticut (SNET Classic) and Yale (Valour Cup). ... New Hampshire is the top-ranked men's team in Division I and Northeastern retains the top spot in the Division I women's ranking, according to U.S. College Hockey Online. In Division III, Plattsburgh (11-0) is the top-ranked team. MARK PARGAS</p></body></html>
