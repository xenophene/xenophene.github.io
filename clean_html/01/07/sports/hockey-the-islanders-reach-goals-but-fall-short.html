<p><strong></strong>At the end of the first period, with the Philadelphia Flyers holding a 2-0 lead, the Islanders assistant coach Greg Cronin walked into the locker room and said what he thought needed to be said.</p><p>Basically, said Islanders defenseman Jamie Heward, ''He challenged whether we were scared to play the game. He challenged our integrity.''</p><p>The result of Cronin's talk was one of those games that the Islanders, who are last in the National Hockey League with 23 points, count as a building block to success. In other words, a loss, but a close one. They rallied from a three-goal deficit before dropping their fifth straight, 3-2, before a sellout crowd of 19,703 at the First Union Center.</p><p>The Flyers, who ran their league-leading home undefeated streak to 14 games, jumped ahead on a goal from Rod Brind'Amour at 6 minutes 25 seconds of the first period. The went ahead, 2-0, when Mikael Renberg scored at 9:55 on the Flyers' league-leading 41st power-play goal Mark Recchi assisted on both goals.</p><p>The Flyers went up by 3-0 on another power-play goal at 13:40 of the second period, this one from Daymond Langkow on the third assist of the game from Recchi while Brad Isbister was in the box. Isbister was called for slashing and unsportsmanlike conduct after tangling with Ulf Samelsson along the boards, a call that had Isbister arguing and an infuriated Islanders Coach Butch Goring yelling at the officials.</p><p>''He kicked my legs out and I went after him, thinking it would be 2 minutes and 2 minutes,'' Isbister said. ''When that didn't happen, the frustration kind of boiled over.''</p><p>Isbister then took on Luke Richardson, with both drawing five minutes for fighting at 13:58. Five seconds later, they were joined by Steve Webb and Craig Berube, who fought at mid-ice, with Webb drawing five minutes for fighting and Berube five minutes for fighting and a 10-minute game misconduct.</p><p>''I came out to try and get a little spark and an emotional boost, and a fight was what I could do,'' Isbister said.</p><p>Tim Connolly then started the rally for the Islanders at 19:11, taking a feed from Dave Scatchard and wristing it past a diving John Vanbiesbrouck from the left side, about 12 feet out, for his sixth goal of the season. Then, at 7:02 of the third period, Jorgen Jonsson scored his sixth goal of the season on a great pass from Bill Muckalt, who sent the puck across the ice even as he was being taken down.</p><p>''With a little luck we could have salvaged a point out of this game,'' Goring said. ''But we showed the kind of character I like to see in a hockey team.''</p><p>Kevin Weekes, who was the last opposing goaltender to win here in the Vancouver Canucks 5-2 victory on Oct. 26, got the loss as the Islanders dropped to 9-24-5.</p><p>The Flyers, winners of four straight, are 23-11-6-1.</p><p>SLAP SHOTS</p><p>KENNY JONSSON, the Islanders' captain, who still has a virus and has lost more than 10 pounds, missed his third straight game Thursday. . . . Flyers Coach ROGER NEILSON, who begins a second phase of treatment for bone marrow cancer on Monday, will be behind the bench as PAT QUINN's assistant along with New Jersey's ROBBIE FTOREK for the 50th All-Star Game on Feb. 6 in Toronto.</p></body></html>
