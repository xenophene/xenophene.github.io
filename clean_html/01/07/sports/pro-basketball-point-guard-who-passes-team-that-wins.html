<p><strong></strong>A month ago, the assessment of Stephon Marbury was as harsh as the Nets were awful. He was viewed as a point guard who would not pass, a player who seemed more concerned with winning a scoring title than with winning games.</p><p>But as the Nets head into tonight's home game against the Vancouver Grizzlies, a different perception of Marbury prevails. Since December, he has not only been one of the league's best point guards but also one of its best players, fulfilling the promise he showed when he broke into the National Basketball Association with the Minnesota Timberwolves in 1996.</p><p>The 22-year-old Marbury has also toned down the harsh attitude that turned off some of his teammates in November, but he has maintained the toughness that makes him such a tenacious competitor. More effective in his play and more supportive of his fellow Nets, he has led the team on a resurgence that could salvage their season and has, for the moment, put them in position to win a franchise-record 10th consecutive home game tonight.</p><p>In what should be his first All-Star season, Marbury will not lead the league in scoring, as he told several people earlier this season that he would do, but he might challenge for the N.B.A.'s assist title. His biggest accomplishment, however, would be to lead the once-fractured and forlorn Nets, once 2-15 and now 12-19, to the playoffs.</p><p>''I think his game has changed along with that of our game,'' Nets General Manager John Nash said. ''We had nobody making shots early in the year and that put a lot of pressure on him, and as a result he took some ill-advised shots, which weren't always his fault. On top of that, he tried to put the team on his back at times.</p><p>''What he does best is make his teammates better, and he's gotten back to doing that in terms of distributing the ball.''</p><p>Marbury's change on the court can be documented. Over the first 17 games, he averaged 20.7 field-goal attempts, shot 38 percent from the floor and gave out 6.6 assists a game. His scoring was high (23.9 points a game), but the team was 2-15.</p><p>Since Dec. 6, a span in which the Nets have put together a 10-4 record, Marbury's shot attempts have dropped to 15.6 a game, his field-goal percentage has risen to nearly 47 percent and his assist average has increased to 9.7, a figure that currently would lead the league.</p><p>''He's capable, in the event that we need a field goal, of going and getting one almost any time we need it,'' Nash said. ''But that's not when we're at our best, because defenses will adjust to that. For us to be at our optimum, I think it's more important that Steph's registering in the vicinity of 10 assists a game than for him to be scoring 25 points.''</p><p>What makes Marbury's transformation more impressive and appear more genuine is the fact that he, not the coaching staff, has been calling most of the plays. There was no official shift, but over the course of the season, Marbury has taken on more of the play-calling responsibilities, and the Nets have been better for it. And rather than use the opportunity to boost his scoring, Marbury has balanced out the offense, gone to the hot man and even made sure to run a few plays for light scorers like Jamie Feick and Jim McIlvaine.</p><p>''We evolved into him calling the plays because he's very intelligent and he's got a good mind for the game, because he watches tons of tape,'' Coach Don Casey said. ''Like Tuesday night against Indiana, he saw that Reggie Miller and Kerry Kittles were in a little confrontation and since Reggie was isolating Kerry, Stephon called the plays that would put Kerry in position to score. I don't know if we would have done it from the bench at that time because we weren't sensing it as much as he was. So in that dimension he has really grown and become a thinking point guard.''</p><p>The reasons Marbury began the season with a scorer's mentality are complex. But the absence of Kittles, who missed 13 of the first 14 games with a sore right knee, and the fact that no other Nets were shooting well, were clearly factors.</p><p>''I think when guys weren't hitting shots, I tried to take it upon myself and tried to carry us,'' Marbury said in a conference call the other day. ''But I should have just kept force-feeding the fact and trying to make guys make shots and put them in situations where they had to. I think now guys are playing a lot more relaxed and playing with a lot more confidence, and now I'm able to go out and play freely as a point guard.''</p><p>Nash and the coaching staff also believe that the end of last season and this preseason may have left Marbury confused about his role. After playing with balance over his first 27 games with the Nets last season, he was asked to take over the scoring the last four games because of injuries to Keith Van Horn, Jayson Williams and Scott Burrell. He averaged 36.5 points and 21.8 shots as the Nets won two of four.</p><p>Apparently thinking he needed to continue to average around 30 points for the Nets to have success, Marbury shot more than ever (23.5 a game) during this year's preseason. That he led the league in scoring (29.3), assists (9.0) and steals (2.88) while the Nets won 5 of 8 preseason games only encouraged him to shoot more. Over the first three regular-season games, he averaged a ridiculous 28.3 shots a game, accounting for one-third of the Nets' field-goal attempts. The team went 0-3.</p><p>Marbury actually began shooting less as early as the fourth game of the season, but as the losing continued, his forceful personality began to irritate some of his teammates. They were also bothered by his propensity for dropping his head and pouting on the court when they missed open shots.</p><p>Some of the Nets criticized Marbury publicly but anonymously. His isolation on the team came to a head when his mother, Mabel Marbury, publicly implied that his teammates were losers and when Marbury wrote ''All Alone 33'' on his ankle tape before the Nets lost to the Washington Wizards on Nov. 30.</p><p>Nash and Casey persuaded Marbury to remove the writing before the game began, and Marbury, who wears jersey number 33, said the message was related to his family, not his team. But some teammates said privately that they were offended.</p><p>Marbury, who earlier had apologized to the team for his mother's comments, apologized to his teammates the next day for writing what could be perceived as a negative statement and then, at the urging of Casey, began changing his body language on the court. He stopped showing frustration with his teammates, and began smiling and giving more high-fives and hugs.</p><p>Since then, Nets players and coaches have said the atmosphere in the locker room has improved.</p><p>''His body demeanor was not good, so we discussed it,'' Casey said. ''And I think he made the adjustment to make a commitment to get everybody involved and not be severely critical or disappointed with his teammates. I think he realized that he can evaluate things and try to make them better without damaging himself.''</p><p>On the contrary, he has evaluated things and made them better while improving himself, his teammates, his game and the Nets.</p></body></html>
