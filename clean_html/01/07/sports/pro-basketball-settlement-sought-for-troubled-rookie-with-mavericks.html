<p><strong></strong>Leon Smith, the troubled 19-year-old suspended by the Dallas Mavericks last month after two arrests, begins his long road back to the National Basketball Association today. Billy Hunter, the executive director of the players' association, who has been acting as Smith's agent and confidant since last month, said Smith was scheduled this morning to check out of the Dallas psychiatric ward where he has been treated since Dec. 5.</p><p>Hunter said that Smith is scheduled to move this weekend to Houston, where Hunter and union officials have arranged for him to live in a furnished apartment. Smith will begin working out immediately at an exclusive health club in Houston where many former pro players work out, among them the future Hall of Famer Moses Malone.</p><p>Hunter is seeking a financial settlement for Smith with the Mavericks, for whom he has never played. Hunter has set March 2 as the date by which he hopes Smith will be signed by an N.B.A. team.</p><p>''Is that realistic?'' Hunter asked. ''We hope so. If for some reason he isn't signed by March 2, by the close of the season we're hoping Leon will be signed by someone. If push comes to shove, if it turns out we can't place him with a team between now and March, then what we will probably do is lean on him and convince him that he's got to at least play some C.B.A. or I.B.L. just for this one season. More important, we're hoping Leon continues to make progress in other areas of his life.''</p><p>A settlement with the Mavericks would terminate Smith's guaranteed contract, worth $1.45 million over three years, a settlement he said he expected to be forthcoming. Hunter, who last month harshly criticized the team in its dealings with Smith before his problems grew, has contended from the beginning that the Mavericks should pay the full amount of Smith's contract.</p><p>Smith was obtained by the Mavericks, in a draft-day deal last June with San Antonio, out of Martin Luther King High School in Chicago. In mid-November, the Dallas police, responding to a call, said they found Smith acting in a bizarre manner. He was admitted to a Dallas psychiatric hospital after having ingested about 250 aspirin tablets in what may have been a suicide attempt, the police said.</p><p>On Dec. 4, Smith was charged in Chicago with two counts of criminal damage after having allegedly rammed a car belonging to his former girlfriend's mother and smashed out all the windows. The day before, Smith had been released from jail after allegedly threatening the former girlfriend with a gun at Marshall High School in Chicago.</p><p>Hunter, who spoke with Smith yesterday, said he did not feel the 6-foot-10-inch, 235-pound teen-ager was rushing back too fast given his problems of the last month.</p><p>''He was very vocal, extremely articulate and fully responsive to everything I said,'' Hunter said of their conversation. ''He was looking forward to further progress.''</p></body></html>
