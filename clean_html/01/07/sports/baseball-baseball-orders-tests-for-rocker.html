<p><strong></strong>Baseball has ordered John Rocker, the Atlanta Braves pitcher, to undergo psychological testing before deciding whether he will be disciplined for the disparaging remarks that he made about gays and minority-group members in a magazine article last month.</p><p>After Rocker's anti-New York diatribe was published in Sports Illustrated, Selig consulted with the Baseball Players Association and then ordered the testing of the 25-year-old closer yesterday. Selig, who apparently did not speak to Rocker before issuing the mandate, called Rocker's remarks ''reprehensible'' and ''completely inexcusable.''</p><p>The Braves followed Selig's four-sentence statement by holding a somber news conference at Turner Field in Atlanta.</p><p>Stan Kasten, the team's president, called Rocker's remarks ''repugnant'' and ''unconscionable'' and said Rocker would probably have been suspended indefinitely had he made them during the season. But even though Kasten said Rocker would obviously have problems repairing relationships with teammates, the club has no plan to trade or release him. He said Rocker was not a bigot and was eager to get help.</p><p>Still, Kasten referred to the Rocker situation as ''horrible'' and ''the most distasteful'' that he has ever been involved in.</p><p>''It's my hope that, if the first step is completely successful and we become satisfied with that, that will go a long way in both the minds of the players on our team and the people in our community to accepting the possibility of moving on with John continuing with our team, being given a second chance,'' Kasten said.</p><p>In the article, Rocker, who said that he could never live in New York, said the No. 7 train to Shea Stadium was like riding through Beirut. He described the subway ride as including ''some kid with purple hair next to some queer with AIDS right next to some dude who just got out of jail for the fourth time next to some 20-year-old mom with four kids.''</p><p>In addition, Rocker complained about New York's ethnic diversity. ''The biggest thing I don't like about New York are the foreigners,'' he said. ''I'm not a very big fan of foreigners. You can walk an entire block in Times Square and not hear anybody speaking English.''</p><p>He added, ''How the hell did they get in this country?''</p><p>He also called a black teammate a ''fat monkey.''</p><p>Rocker, who was driving his car for part of the interview, also maligned Asian-American women, spit at a toll machine after it failed to open and made a vulgar gesture to another driver who honked at him.</p><p>''I am profoundly concerned about the nature of those comments, as well as by certain other aspects of his behavior,'' Selig said in a statement. ''As a result, following consultation with the Major League Baseball Players Association, I have determined that Mr. Rocker will undergo a psychological evaluation, which I expect to be concluded expeditiously. At that time, I will take whatever additional action that I consider to be necessary.''</p><p>Rocker, who met with Kasten and General Manager John Schuerholz for several hours at Turner Field on Dec. 29 to discuss his remarks, has said that he is not a racist and has apologized.</p><p>Kasten said that Rocker had various explanations for the different insensitive comments he made, but he would not reveal them. The Braves advised Rocker about ''anger issues'' after his continuous verbal battles with fans who were deriding him at Shea Stadium.</p><p>''He was counseled by us because it's clearly not appropriate for a professional athlete to become unwound, if you will,'' Schuerholz said.</p><p>Major League Baseball told the Braves last Friday that it would take over Rocker's situation because it affects everyone in baseball. Kasten said baseball and union officials decided that a psychological evaluation was appropriate and added that baseball, not the Braves, would mete any discipline of Rocker. In 1996, the American League ordered Albert Belle to undergo counseling following a series of incidents.</p><p>Alan Hendricks, one of Rocker's agents, did not return a telephone message yesterday.</p><p>Gene Orza, the associate general counsel for the players association, also did not return a message. But he told the Associated Press that the association did not ''necessarily agree with the characterization of the procedure being discussed concerning Mr. Rocker.'' The union prefers to not have medical evaluations publicized.</p><p>Selig declined an interview request. ''There's not much more he can say,'' said Pat Courtney, one of baseball's spokesmen. ''It's in the doctor's hands to make an evaluation and then get back to him.''</p><p>While baseball began acting on Rocker's remarks almost three weeks after they appeared, the words continued to stir debates. Jack Ellis, the mayor of Macon, Ga., Rocker's hometown, said that the comments should be condemned, but the person should not be condemned. Ellis, who is the first African-American mayor of Macon, has met with Rocker's father, Jake, but not with Rocker. Kasten said that part of Rocker's rehabilitation should include another public apology and discussions with community leaders.</p><p>The Atlanta City Council unanimously adopted a resolution on Monday to condemn the comments made by Rocker, and it was signed by Mayor Bill Campbell on Tuesday. The resolution stated that diversity, whether ethnic, cultural, social or spiritual, is what has made America great and called on the Braves to release Rocker.</p><p>While Kasten conceded that releasing or trading Rocker was an option and that the Braves would have released him if they thought he was an ''unrepentant bigot,'' the team's belief in Rocker's contrition makes that seem unlikely.</p><p>''What we have here is a case of a player who, to me, at least, has expressed a great deal of remorse immediately and hasn't backed away from that at all, has accepted responsibility and has sought help,'' Kasten said. ''Under those circumstances, I'm not going to abandon a player, an employee or a friend who is in that circumstance.''</p></body></html>
