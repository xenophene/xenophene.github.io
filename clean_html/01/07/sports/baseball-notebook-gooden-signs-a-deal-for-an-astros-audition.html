<p><strong></strong>His first major league start was in Houston and Dwight Gooden, then 19 years old, was so nervous that he walked from the team hotel to the ballpark -- four miles, as he remembers it -- and arrived at the Astrodome about six hours before game time.</p><p>The thought occurred to Gooden at the time that this was it, this was his big chance. Now, 16 years later, he will get another chance in Houston.</p><p>Gooden, 35, agreed to a minor league contract yesterday and will attend spring training with the Astros next month as a nonroster player. If he impresses, he will receive an incentive-laden major league deal and most likely pitch in the Houston rotation, joining Jose Lima and Shane Reynolds.</p><p>The Astros are trying to bolster their rotation, after unloading Mike Hampton in a trade with the Mets last month. ''I'm pretty excited about this,'' said Larry Dierker, the Astros' manager. ''Obviously when we traded Mike Hampton, we created a void.''</p><p>Gooden is at the stage in a career loaded with incredible achievements and personal failures where he needs to show he can produce consistently. After going 20-12 for the Yankees in 1996-97, he spent two years with Cleveland, and although the Indians' offense is generally capable of remarkable run support, he won 11 games in two seasons, accumulating a 6.26 earned run average in 26 games last summer, when he lost his spot in the rotation. Injuries hampered him and, as he acknowledged yesterday on a conference call with reporters, he has lost velocity on his once overpowering fastball.</p><p>But Gooden believes he can continue to adjust to his evolving repertory. ''I feel real good,'' he said. ''I'm healthy. At 35, I don't expect to be the same pitcher I was at 27, but I can be a good pitcher.''</p><p>Gerry Hunsicker, the Houston general manager, said, ''If you look between the lines the last couple of years, you'll find some bright spots.''</p><p>If Gooden makes the Astros, he may have his first chance to pitch in Shea Stadium since he last pitched for the Mets in 1994. ''I wouldn't necessarily say I want to pay them back,'' he said, ''but I'm looking forward to pitching against them.''</p><p>Gooden was among a large contingent of veteran pitchers still unsigned. Aaron Sele, Andy Benes and Omar Olivares are among those looking for deals for next season.</p><p>A major league official indicated that Sele was in serious negotiations with the Baltimore Orioles and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. The addition of Sele is of great importance to the Orioles, a rival of the Yankees in the American League East. If Baltimore is to come back from what was considered a horrendous season in 1999, it will be on the strength of its pitching rotation, which includes Mike Mussina, Scott Erickson and the talented youngster Sidney Ponson.</p><p>Yanks Get a Sprinter</p><p>Fine-tuning their roster in the last weeks before spring training, the Yankees acquired outfielder Terry Jones from the Los Angeles Dodgers yesterday for a player to be named.</p><p>Jones, who turns 29 next month, is not considered a good hitter, but he possesses excellent speed and if Manager Joe Torre and the staff elect to keep him on the major league roster -- and there seems to be a good chance of that -- he could be used as a pinch-runner, in the same way Homer Bush was employed during the 1998 season.</p><p>The Yankees currently have four outfielders virtually assured of being on the opening day roster, in Bernie Williams, Paul O'Neill, Ricky Ledee and Shane Spencer. There is a need for a fifth outfielder, and the Yankees have signed the veterans Ryan Thompson (formerly of the Mets) and Felix Jose (34 years old and once a star with the Cardinals).</p><p>But among the outfield candidates, Jones would provide the Yankees with the one element Torre often said the team lacked last year: speed. Jones played most of last season at Class AAA Ottawa, in the Montreal organization, and swiped 30 bases in 40 attempts over 88 games. He has played 89 games in the majors and stolen 17 bases in 23 attempts.</p><p>The Dodgers acquired Jones from the Expos, but no longer needed him after signing the free agent outfielder F. P. Santangelo on Wednesday.</p></body></html>
