<p><strong></strong>Fifteen months ago, when John Muckler began his first full season as coach of the Rangers, he said his players would use attack-zone pressure and puck pursuit. They would skate at high tempo to create exciting scoring chances in the manner of the Edmonton Oilers of the 1980's and early 1990's. Those Oilers won the Stanley Cup five times with Muckler on the coaching staff, the last as head coach in 1990.</p><p>But the Rangers of 1998-99 were slow and old, lacking the necessities for that aggressive approach. And the philosophy of the National Hockey League had changed, particularly in the Eastern Conference. Ever since the Devils won the cup in 1995 with the neutral-zone trap, games were played at a plodding pace, with average scores dropping.</p><p>Even though Western Conference teams, Detroit and Colorado, had won the last three championships, Eastern teams still played cautiously while attendance slipped and television ratings dipped. Instead of swimming against the Eastern tide, Muckler's Rangers tried a slower and more defensive system, but did not reach the playoffs last spring.</p><p>But something else did happen last spring to offer hope for Eastern fans and for coaches like Muckler. The Toronto Maple Leafs, having moved from the Western Conference to the East, played a speedy and entertaining style to reach the third round of the playoffs. This season, the Leafs are the top team in the East and are tied with Detroit for the overall lead in the 28-team league.</p><p>Like a brisk and refreshing breeze from Canada, the Leafs performed in Madison Square Garden on Wednesday night. The Rangers, having added some youth and speed this season, matched them stride for stride in winning a thrilling 3-2 decision in overtime on a goal by Adam Graves. The two teams will meet again in Toronto on Saturday night in a rarity: a game that Ranger fans can actually look forward to. They will see if New York's newly formed Czech line of Petr Nedved, Jan Hlavac and Radek Dvorak can put another 11 shots on goalie Curtis Joseph, as they did on Wednesday. Perhaps they will see Nedved score another goal, as he did Wednesday to break a slump of more than a month.</p><p>''It was fun,'' Nedved said of Wednesday's pace. ''We created a lot of chances. We used our speed and passing.'' Of Toronto's style, Nedved said: ''There are not too many teams anymore like that. It's too bad.''</p><p>Yes, but fans will soon see more of them if the trend extends beyond Toronto, where the team president, Ken Dryden, has refashioned his franchise. The Pittsburgh Penguins, under the new ownership of Mario Lemieux, are 9-4 in their last 13 games since Herb Brooks was named coach. Lemieux and Brooks are progressives who are outspoken about improving hockey's entertainment value. The Penguins had a setback when the Devils beat them by 3-1 Wednesday night with tight checking.</p><p>But even the Devils are taking more chances on offense in the Robbie Ftorek era than they did under Jacques Lemaire. Another hopeful sign is in Chicago, where the pathetic Blackhawks recently hired Mike Smith as director of hockey operations. Smith was Dryden's top aide last season in Toronto. Before that, Smith built the Winnipeg Jets, who are now the Phoenix Coyotes. A native of the United States, Smith was ahead of many counterparts in recognizing and acquiring European talent. It is more than coincidence that Toronto and Pittsburgh, two of the most interesting teams in the East, are loaded with European skaters. And the Devils have their share, too.</p><p>The Rangers seemed similarly directed in 1994, when four Russians helped Coach Mike Keenan's cup champions. But under Keenan's successor, Colin Campbell, who is now a league executive, most Russian Rangers fell from favor and were gradually dispatched by General Manager Neil Smith. All have revived their careers with good teams like Toronto (Aleksandr Karpovtsev), Dallas (Sergei Zubov), New Jersey (Sergei Nemchinov) and Pittsburgh (Aleksei Kovalev).</p><p>It is difficult to reverse five seasons of management mistakes, but now Smith seems to be trying, if only to save his job. Besides the three members of the Czech line, Smith has added Valery Kamensky of Russia and Kim Johnsson of Sweden. Pavel Brendl of the Czech Republic is the top prospect in the system.</p><p>Another cause for Ranger optimism is the projected return in two weeks of Brian Leetch, the attacking defenseman, out since Nov. 24 with a broken arm. Leetch's impact has diminished in recent seasons, but he is a quick and skilled athlete who fits best in a speedier format. The elements could be there for Leetch to revive his star stature.</p><p>''I'm looking forward to the day Leetch comes back,'' Muckler said. ''He definitely makes us a better hockey club. We need another offensive defenseman.''</p><p>So why be negative, even about a Ranger team with a record of 13-19-7 and one victory in its last eight games? If you tune in Saturday night, you might sneak a peek at the near future and like what you see, a glimpse of what drew hockey fans to a great sport in the first place.</p></body></html>
