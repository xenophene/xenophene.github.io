<p><strong></strong>SATURDAY 12:30 P.M.</p><p>Buffalo (11-5) at Tennessee (13-3)</p><p>Buffalo has bushels of playoff experience but the Titans are playoff green. There is dramatic playoff history between these teams -- in 1993, Buffalo staged the biggest comeback in National Football League history, rallying from a 35-3 second-half deficit to win in overtime, 41-38. But only a handful of players from each side were around for that one. This time, the matchup features players who have combined for 24 victories, the most ever in a wild-card battle. One of them, Doug Flutie, is fuming. He started the first 15 games at quarterback for Buffalo and then, in the regular-season finale, lost his job to Rob Johnson. Johnson sparkled in that last game, against Indianapolis, and the Bills say that he gives them a bigger passer, a more dangerous deep threat and extra confidence. Meanwhile, watch the old pro (Buffalo defensive end Bruce Smith) and compare him with the new one (Tennessee's Jevon Kearse) in a splendid fight of sack specialists. Three factors turn the game Tennessee's way: 1.) Running back Eddie George, simply a brute when running or receiving. 2.) The Tennessee crowd at Adelphia Coliseum, where the Titans this season are 8-0. 3.) Buffalo is minus-6 in turnover differential, whereas Tennessee is plus 18. (Titans, 26-23)</p><p>SATURDAY 4:05 P.M.</p><p>Detroit (8-8) at Washington (10-6)</p><p>The Lions look at the Redskins and usually quiver. Especially in Washington. Detroit has not beaten the Redskins on the road since 1935, when the Redskins were in Boston. Detroit has lost 19 consecutive games in Washington. Here is why the Lions have hope: they beat Washington, 33-17, in early December in a Detroit home game. Gus Frerotte, the former Redskin, started that game at quarterback and completed five passes for 122 yards to receiver Germane Crowell. Frerotte starts again because Charlie Batch has an injured thumb and will likely not play in the postseason. Stephen Davis is Washington's big, bullying running back who rumbled for a league-most 1,405 yards and 17 touchdowns. Quarterback Brad Johnson passed for 4,005 yards and 24 touchdowns, and Redskins receivers Albert Connell and Michael Westbrook both produced 1,000-yard seasons. Washington won the N.F.C. East with offense but here is bad news for Detroit: In Washington's last four games, its defense has allowed an average of only 14.3 points. Detroit offers a valiant fight but finishes short. (Redskins, 30-24)</p><p>SUNDAY 12:35 P.M.</p><p>Dallas (8-8) at Minnesota (10-6)</p><p>There are reasons the Dallas Cowboys have been so visible and so celebrated. Dallas leads the N.F.L. in playoff appearances (26), games (52) and victories (32). The Cowboys played at Minnesota in early November and exploded to a 17-7 lead. Dallas, collapsed, though, as Minnesota outscored the Cowboys, 20-0, in the second half. How can Dallas avoid a repeat? It will be tough because the Vikings are deeper in talent and have more stamina. Dallas must hope for turnovers (it is plus-10 in turnover differential while Minnesota is minus-10) and hope to prevent big passing plays. The Randy Moss-Cris Carter receiving combination burned the Cowboys for 15 receptions for 207 yards and three touchdowns in the last meeting. The game turns most, however, on the quick, churning legs of Minnesota back Robert Smith on his trap runs and screen passes. He is the player the Dallas defense will find that it cannot answer.</p><p>(Vikings, 30-21)</p><p>SUNDAY 4:05 P.M.</p><p>Miami (9-7) at Seattle (9-7)</p><p>Miami runs into a frenzied nest. It must play in the Kingdome, where the fans are hungry for the first playoff action there in 16 years. The Dolphins' chief concern must be execution, something hard to come by for a team on the road in a dome, a team that has struggled mightily in search of precise play in recent weeks. However, the Dan Marino vs. John Kitna battle should favor Marino and the Dolphins. Marino has plenty of playoff experience while Kitna makes his first playoff start. Expect Marino to improve on his recent, sluggish play but for those around him on offense, eventually, to falter. Both teams lost last week but still earned a playoff spot. Miami this season was supposed to have the better defense, but the Seattle defense leads the league in interceptions (30) and Pro Bowl linebacker Chad Brown and tackle Cortez Kennedy will produce big games. Watch the rookie punt returner Charlie Rogers give Seattle prime field position -- he led the league with a 14.5-punt return average.</p></body></html>
