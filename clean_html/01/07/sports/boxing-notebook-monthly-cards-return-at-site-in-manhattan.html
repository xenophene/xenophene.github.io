<p><strong></strong>For the first time in seven years, a boxing promoter has decided to venture into New York City with a regular monthly boxing show. The promoter, Cedric Kushner, said yesterday that he will hold his ''Heavyweight Explosion'' cards at the Hammerstein Ballroom in midtown Manhattan on the last Thursday of each month, beginning on Jan. 27.</p><p>The first card will feature a co-main event, with matches between Kirk Johnson (28-0-1) and Israel Cole (15-9-4), and Monte Barrett (21-1) and Derrick Banks (19-4-1).</p><p>''I remember attending the Felt Forum monthly boxing shows and having a great deal of fun,'' Kushner said, recalling the last regular monthly boxing event in Manhattan. ''It's kind of difficult and fascinating to think that the most important city in the world doesn't have a regular monthly boxing show.''</p><p>For six years, Kushner has been promoting ''Heavyweight Explosion'' shows, which are broadcast via syndication in 110 countries. Kushner said he had decided that instead of staging the shows in different cities around the world, he would limit them to one venue. He chose the Hammerstein Ballroom because of its ambience and because the main ballroom seats 2,000 people.</p><p>Kushner envisions the monthly shows as a kind of party with boxing as the centerpiece.</p><p>''I don't think this will be just another show,'' he said. ''There are lots of boxing shows in and around New York. We have an agreement with a record company that will provide some new artists that will perform songs in the ring prior to the main event.''</p><p>Kushner, who has 35 heavyweight boxers under contract, said each show would feature eight bouts and the main event would go on around 10 p.m.</p><p>The artist LeRoy Neiman, who drew the mural for Kushner's show, recalled that New York City used to be a hotbed of monthly boxing shows and that a lot of young talent used those shows as proving grounds.</p><p>''I remember going to see Ali fight Billy Daniels at St. Nick's,'' Neiman said. ''I went to his dressing room after the fight and Ali was just sitting there with no one around. I began to sketch him. He said, 'Let me draw something.' I gave him my sketch pad and he drew a few sketches on there.''</p><p>Tickets are $25 to $125 and Kushner said he was selling season tickets, and had sold about 400.</p><p>While HBO is one of the sponsors of Kushner's card, the bouts will be syndicated by Comcast, MSG Network and Fox New England.</p><p>''I think something like this does more to build up boxing in New York than having one or two big shows here a year,'' said Lou DiBella, senior vice president of programming for HBO/TVKO. ''I applaud what Cedric is doing. He's taking a chance and he's building the sport.''</p><p>Briggs Wants Tyson</p><p>Shannon Briggs said his representatives were working on a March 25 date with Mike Tyson at Continental Arena in the Meadowlands. Nothing will be completed with Tyson until after he fights Julius Francis on Jan. 29.</p><p>Briggs has been trying to get a fight with Tyson for a year. There was talk that Briggs and Tyson would meet at Madison Square Garden, but Briggs said Garden officials soured on Tyson after his no contest against Orlin Norris in October.</p><p>Lewis-Grant Almost Set</p><p>The deal for a Lennox Lewis-Michael Grant heavyweight championship bout at Madison Square Garden on April 29 is nearly completed. ''It's so close you could say it's done,'' said Lou DiBella, senior vice president of programming for HBO/TVKO. If it happens it will be a major coup for Kevin Wynne, vice president of sports properties for MSG.</p><p>Wynne has helped negotiate deals that will give New York City three of the biggest bouts in boxing during the first three months of 2000. Wynne's scorecard reads: Roy Jones Jr. versus David Telesco at Radio City Music Hall on Jan. 15; Oscar De La Hoya against Derrell Coley on Feb. 26 at the Garden, and the Lewis-Grant bout.</p><p>The Ring as a Stage</p><p>Whitney Houston will perform the national anthem at the Jones-Telesco light heavyweight championship bout. Houston will also perform a song before Jones enters the ring. The bout will be broadcast on HBO.</p></body></html>
