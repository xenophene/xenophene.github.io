<p><strong></strong>Bill Parcells today squashed any perception that the Jets were a rudderless team, vowing that the club ''will not go down the tubes.''</p><p>In his first formal news conference since he resigned Monday, Parcells told a group of reporters on a conference call that he would remain the head of the Jets' football operations and would not return as head coach in the wake of the sudden resignation of his replacement, Bill Belichick, on Tuesday.</p><p>But after a lengthy and sometimes convoluted interview session, it seemed that Parcells would consider a new owner's plea to return as coach.</p><p>''This is on my watch now,'' Parcells said. ''I feel a very strong obligation to this organization and I have since the day I came here, and I'm not going to abandon this organization. But what I said Monday is the truth. I, in my heart of hearts, when I made that statement Monday, that was completely my intention. I'm not leaving the door open. I'm not trying to create any little window or ray of light to deviate from that statement. I don't know what the future will hold.</p><p>''I certainly wouldn't make any leverage presentation to any owner about anything of that nature. But I do want to discuss with the new owner what he wants done here. Then, after that, I will have a reaction -- but my intention is to stay retired as a coach.''</p><p>Belichick's lawyer, Neil Cornrich, today filed a grievance with Commissioner Paul Tagliabue ''to allow Bill to be employed in the National Football League.''</p><p>Speaking from Cleveland, Cornrich said that the letter detailed his position on Belichick's contract with the Jets and included ''further relevant information.'' Cornrich did not elaborate about the terms of the eight-page letter.</p><p>Tagliabue has upheld the Jets' position that Belichick is still under contract for three years.</p><p>The letter was received today by the league, and the Jets have until Monday to respond. Cornrich repeated his contention that the contract Belichick signed to replace Parcells as head coach was invalid once the team's owner, Leon Hess, died in May. Thus, according to the grievance, Belichick had a right to decline the head-coaching post and to resign without remaining the Jets' property.</p><p>Asked about Belichick's resignation, Parcells said: ''I was surprised. I quite honestly was. I don't know that the word surprise would be appropriate.''</p><p>Parcells believed that even though Belichick had expressed second thoughts on Monday morning, all those had been resolved by Tuesday, the day the Jets were to formally introduce Belichick as their new coach.</p><p>''You know, I didn't see him on Tuesday to have any conversation with him because I was doing television and I was getting a haircut in the building,'' Parcells said. ''He did come in when he showed me the note which was right before the press conference. He said, 'Gee I didn't get a chance to talk to you because you were doing things.' ''</p><p>Did Parcells try to dissuade him?</p><p>''I didn't have time to talk him out of it,'' Parcells said. ''He made up his mind.''</p><p>Is it possible that Belichick could return to be reunited with Parcells, and resume a relationship that began in 1981 when both were Giants' assistants?</p><p>''I don't think so,'' Parcells said. ''There is no possibility that would happen, I would think.''</p><p>Parcells has described his relationship with Belichick as ''businesslike.'' Parcells often said they would have ''talks at the water cooler,'' rather than on a social basis.</p><p>When Belichick was told of Parcells's characterization of their relationship, he said: ''Well, we've been together 15 years. I felt there was more to it on my end.''</p><p>The Jets not only have lost their respected defensive coordinator in Belichick, but they also are in danger of losing their esteemed defensive line coach, Romeo Crennel. Parcells disclosed today that he had given the Browns permission to interview Crennel for the club's vacant defensive coordinator's position.</p><p>If Parcells sticks to his stance that he will not return, he will have to find a new head coach, a new defensive coordinator and possibly a new defensive line coach.</p><p>If Parcells were to reward the top job to the linebackers coach Al Groh, that would deprive the defense of its three position coaches as well, since Belichick also instructed the secondary.</p><p>As it is, Belichick's departure leaves the Jets in a worse position. In 12 seasons on Parcells's staff, the teams posted a 128-78-1 mark, including playoffs. When Parcells has been head coach without Belichick on his staff, his clubs were 21-28, including playoffs.</p><p>Parcells said that in his search for a new head coach, he would consider members of his current staff, but he added: ''I can't talk about anybody now. I'm comprising some lists at this moment. I have given my word to all the parties involved that we will do nothing until there is new ownership.''</p></body></html>
