<p><strong></strong>Patrick Ewing was about to leave the Knicks' practice site when the subject of his rehabilitated Achilles' tendon was raised on Wednesday afternoon. He put down the bags he was carrying and asked for a bottle of water, realizing that when the subject is his health, he cannot escape quickly.</p><p>Ewing does not understand why the questions still arise at all. Had he not proved himself through 11 games since his return in early December? He has played 31.1 minutes per game and shown no ill effects, scoring 12.6 points and grabbing 9.9 rebounds.</p><p>But the questions still come, this time on how he will respond to the first set of back-to-back games the Knicks have played since his return. The team took the day off yesterday and flew to Orlando, where it will face the Magic tomorrow night. Then the Knicks return home to play host to the Cleveland Cavaliers on Saturday night.</p><p>''I really haven't given it a thought,'' Ewing said. ''I'm fine. I feel good. My Achilles' feels great. That's why it took me a while to come back.''</p><p>That was Ewing's reasoning throughout his prolonged recovery period, that he would not come back this season until he was fully healed. His approach was understandable after he suffered through injury-plagued seasons the last two years.</p><p>This time, Ewing sat out training camp and the first 20 games of the regular season before deeming himself ready to play. But the Knicks' schedule had been favorable for him until now, when the team faces six games in nine days, set up in three pairs of back-to-back games.</p><p>''Back-to-backs don't have anything to do with it,'' Ewing said. ''I just wanted to make sure I was healthy, all the pain was gone, and when I came back I wasn't going to keep reinjuring it. Everybody needs recovery time. Last year, I was hurt. And I didn't give it enough time to heal. I'm healed now.''</p><p>Last year, with the injury hampering him all season, Ewing played in back-to-back games 10 times; in those games, he played an average of 36.8 minutes and scored 19.7 points per game. Coach Jeff Van Gundy of the Knicks expressed as little concern as Ewing did for the schedule this season.</p><p>''Like anything else, we'll wait and see how it goes,'' Van Gundy said. ''Until you get in the game, you don't know that.''</p><p>Ewing insisted that he does not doubt his ability to withstand the schedule's rigors. ''I'm back,'' he said. ''I think everything feels good. Everything is back.''</p><p>He passed another test in the Knicks' game on Tuesday night, when he sat out for a prolonged period in the second half, then came off the bench and showed no ill effects.</p><p>''Historically, it takes him a long time to warm up,'' Van Gundy said. ''Some of our guys have not handled foul trouble well, when they sit long periods and have to play after sitting a long time. I thought he did a good job with that.''</p><p>On Tuesday, Van Gundy's complaints and concerns were focused more on the foul calls that sent Ewing to the bench. He argued that the officials had not given Ewing the benefit of the calls a star usually gets since his return.</p><p>''To me, since he's been back, they've forgotten about him the last three years,'' Van Gundy said. ''I don't think he's gotten a good whistle at all. The guy gets fouled a lot. The other teams don't show him respect. They know they just foul him now. I'm not begging for it, because he doesn't need that.''</p><p>Ewing was not asking for it either, picking up his bags and saying his farewells by declaring: ''I'm just ready to play. The team feels good. We've just got to keep going and get better.''</p></body></html>
