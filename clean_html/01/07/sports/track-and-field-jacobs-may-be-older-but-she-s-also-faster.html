<p><strong></strong>Regina Jacobs quickly says that older is better. At 36, she says, she is a faster runner than ever, and her race results show that.</p><p>In last year's world track and field championships in Seville, Spain, no American man won a medal at a distance longer than 400 meters. The only American woman who won a medal at longer than 200 meters was Jacobs, the silver medalist in the 1,500.</p><p>Can Jacobs keep running fast? Yes, she says. Yes, says her coach and husband, Tom Craig. Yes, says Arthur Lydiard, the legendary coach from New Zealand who spent a week with Jacobs and Craig at their Oakland, Calif., home analyzing her career.</p><p>One conclusion was that Jacobs could continue to run often. So while many runners will scale back on their race schedules this year to prepare for the September Olympics in Sydney, Australia, she will run her usual heavy schedules indoors and outdoors.</p><p>Tomorrow, she will run the women's mile in the New Balance Games at the Armory Track and Field Center. In a meet otherwise limited to high school athletes, she will run in one of the four elite races. Her opponents include Sinead Delahunty of Ireland, last year's winner; Debbie Grant and Kathy Franey Fleming.</p><p>At 5 feet 6 inches and 112 pounds, Jacobs looks sleek rather than strong. But physical strength is her running strength, she said, partly ''because I do weights all year round; I don't get out of shape.''</p><p>That strength helped her achieve a 1,500-5,000 double in last year's national outdoor championships. Had she used her strength better in the world championships, she said, she might have beaten Svetlana Masterkova of Russia and won a gold medal.</p><p>''I played to Masterkova's strength,'' she said. ''She can run 400 meters in 51 seconds and I can't run it faster than 54. My strength is endurance, not speed, so I'm going to work on very long kicks. There's a point in a race where people like to rest. We do a lot of that in our thinking. When everyone else is resting, I'm going to be running.''</p><p>Jacobs, who has a bachelor's degree from Stanford and an M.B.A. from California at Berkeley, has always been honest in judging herself.</p><p>''I think what we learned is that there's not much more room to get faster or get more endurance,'' she said. ''I am at my peak. But I can increase my strength, and there is more maturity. You don't have that when you're 25 years old.</p><p>''At 25, I could be racing and find myself in a box and I can't go and it's no big deal. Last year, at 35, Masterkova had me boxed and I got out of there. Having maturity is invaluable.''</p><p>Having speed helps, too. Jacobs's fastest 1,500 ever was 4 minutes 0.35 second behind Masterkova's 3:59.53 in the world championships.</p><p>''Regina has been ready to run 3:55 or 3:58,'' Craig said. ''She's been doing 4:03 in workouts. A lot of it has to do with confidence and belief. Every year, she's been getting better with that. She's trained enough to go under four minutes. Now it's mental.''</p><p>All concerned say that age, at least for now, is no barrier. Craig said of their discussions with Lydiard: ''We went over Regina's history since she was 14. We looked at the last six years very closely. I asked him what he thought about her future. He said he thought she could have two more years at this level.'</p><p>Jacobs said she had already been thinking about two more years at this level.</p><p>''The physical part,'' she said, ''I don't want to discount. The mental part is important because if it's time to leave, it's time.''</p><p>INSIDE TRACK</p><p>In addition to the women's mile, the elite races in tomorrow's New Balance Games will be the men's mile (RICHIE BOULET, MARK CARROLL and PAUL McMULLEN), the men's 3,000 meters (BRIAN BAKER and TOM NOHILLY) and the women's 3,000 (MOLLY WATKE and ALISA HARVEY). The rest of the program on the 200-meter banked Mondo track will involve more than 4,000 athletes from more than 160 high schools. During the meet, New Balance will present the first Glickman awards to the track programs of A. P. Randolph High School in Manhattan ($10,000) and Staten Island Technical High School ($5,000). The awards, honoring academics, team spirit and community service, are named for MARTY GLICKMAN, an Olympic sprinter and Hall of Fame broadcaster.</p></body></html>
