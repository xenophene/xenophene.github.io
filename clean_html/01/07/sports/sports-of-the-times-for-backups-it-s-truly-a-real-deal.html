<p><strong></strong>WHEN the call came in, Mary Frances Monroe was out, visiting with her boyfriend. Her mother, Eileen, received the news and took it upon herself to let out a joyous yelp. Then she telephoned her daughter and said, ''Sit down.''</p><p>It was winter break, the Christmas season, and time to unwrap an inadvertent present from, among others, Mia Hamm. In a contractual huff, the women who own American soccer had abruptly decided to rent out their pre-eminent rank and national team numbers.</p><p>''You're going to Australia,'' she told her daughter, who emitted her own, louder scream.</p><p>Nobody is expecting the replacement players (not to be mistaken for replacement workers) dispatched to Melbourne for the Australia Cup that begins today to fill the cleats of this country's most celebrated women's sports team ever. Without Mia and the gang, the masses won't even bother to notice that an international tournament is being played.</p><p>''When I got the call, I was shocked,'' Christie Welsh, another of the young stand-ins, said recently. ''I thought they were sending the real -- I mean, the veterans.''</p><p>After months of celebrating and touring, the real -- I mean, the veterans -- probably weren't too keen on committing themselves to wing halfway 'round the world last Sunday night, before every airport computer was declared fully operational.</p><p>By June, when the World Cup team will have switched sanctioning bodies and again becomes the United States Olympians, the old standbys will be in Australia for Sydney dress rehearsals. But for the next week, during games against the Czech Republic, Sweden and Australia, auditions are being held for the not-too-distant future, when the doddering pioneers will be shown to their rockers.</p><p>Time does not suspend itself for those who seem irreplaceable, larger than life. It didn't for Wayne Gretzky and Michael Jordan. It won't for Bill Parcells and Brandi Chastain.</p><p>Growing up in Lindenhurst on Long Island, Mary Frances Monroe said she could recall playing on a select team of 12-year-olds in the first game of a doubleheader. After the second game, which featured the United States national team against Canada, Monroe ran on the field and filled her notebook with the scribbled signatures of the coolest women on earth.</p><p>Michelle Akers. Julie Foudy. Kristine Lilly. Before last summer's World Cup, Monroe practiced with them all.</p><p>''They seemed so nice when I was 12,'' she said. ''They seemed even nicer when I was 19.''</p><p>She still has the autographs somewhere. Over the years, as these prizes escalated in value, Monroe followed the path of the trailblazers. She won a scholarship to the University of Connecticut. She became first-team all-American, a 5-foot dynamo at midfield, whom her teammates affectionately call Squirt. Her fraternal twin, Jean Marie, was a college goalie for one season, but recently quit.</p><p>''Jean Marie is the taller one, 5-5,'' Eileen Monroe said. ''But she didn't have the same love of it as Mary Frances.''</p><p>Thanks largely to the team that stayed home, the players are now coming in all shapes and sizes. Welsh, who scored 27 goals as a Penn State freshman, is 10 inches taller than her friend, Mary Frances.</p><p>Welsh grew up in Massapequa Park, a short drive from the Monroes. The two budding stars played together on several club teams and met at the airport last Sunday night for the long haul to Melbourne, through Los Angeles. They were not exactly going off as frightened travelers. Monroe, 19, has already had her passport stamped in England, Denmark, Germany, Belgium and China.</p><p>''China,'' Eileen Monroe said. ''My husband and I have never even been out of the country.''</p><p>Robert Monroe, she said, works two jobs, and she pitches in with additional income as a nanny. They have five children; there are sacrifices to feeding and educating them all. But if the world has opened up to Mary Frances, Eileen believes her daughter has earned it.</p><p>''This has been her dream from the time she was a little girl,'' she said. ''She slept with a soccer ball. When she was 8, her coaches used to tell us, 'She's going to be a national team player.' We would say, 'Get real.' ''</p><p>Who is to say who the real national team players are? Given time to think about it, Welsh decided that there might even be a few Olympic team positions opening up, given a few well-timed goals down under.</p><p>''Why not?'' Welsh said.</p><p>Why not? Even Mia and Brandi, at some point, were given an inch, and wound up taking the world.</p></body></html>
