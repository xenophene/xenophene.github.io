<p><strong></strong>Jason Sehorn watched the beginning and the end of the Giants' just completed season from the sideline. In September and December, Sehorn nursed different injuries, but from month to month, even week to week, he recognized something troubling.</p><p>''One game, like when we opened up at Tampa Bay, we were out there just killing people,'' Sehorn said Monday in the Giants' locker room. ''A week later I looked out there and said: 'What happened? Where did that team from last week go?' Our attitude for winning just comes and goes. You want to know what has to be addressed and fixed? That's what needs to be addressed and fixed.''</p><p>Inside Giants Stadium, where the coaches and the team's management will meet this week, they know they had a number of players disappear in games from time to time. When the meetings are done, some of those players will disappear for good.</p><p>Because the Giants do not have enough good players or enough players who desperately want to be good. That has to be sinking in by now.</p><p>At some point in the discussions, Jim Fassel and his coaches will feel the scrutiny of evaluation, too. Sure, Fassel will get a contract extension, but the Giants have to make the playoffs next season and look like an ascending team, or that is relocation money. Fassel understands this. His players got to take home all sorts of personal statistics -- yards gained, tackles made, interceptions -- this week. Fassel, grouchily, took home just one stat: 7-9.</p><p>So this is getting personal.</p><p>Fassel may also know it's time to step even farther away from the offensive decision-making. That could be an informal condition of his contract extension.</p><p>The Giants simply have to be more bold, because they do not have enough team speed, because their defense is getting old and because it is absolutely imperative they use their first-round draft pick -- the 11th pick over all -- to draft the best college running back available to balance quarterback Kerry Collins and his slowly maturing receivers.</p><p>The Giants need a dominant running back like Bill Belichick needs a lawyer and a hot iron. Joe Montgomery, the rookie running back, did some nice things this season, but he was also hurt for two long stretches. The Giants, and Fassel, have no time left for hoping and guessing at running back. Give Collins a bona fide running attack to keep the pass rush out of his face, and maybe for the first time since 1993 the Giants have a real offensive attack.</p><p>Next, the Giants need to put everybody on edge in their locker room, where things have been just a bit too cozy the last two years. By the May mini-camps, there might be as many as eight new starters in next season's lineup. So who goes?</p><p>Marcus Buckley, due to earn $1.1 million next season, will not be back. And don't be surprised when the Giants ignore the free-agent cornerback Phillippi Sparks's contract demands, which are expected to be in the $5 million range. Sparks, who has lost a step, will be 31 in April. There will be other free-agent cornerbacks available, younger ones at that.</p><p>Center Brian Williams may not be back. He has expressed some reservations about whether he wants to continue his career. Williams, who will be 34 in June, had a host of injuries this season. The team is looking hard at the $500,000 bonus Williams is owed on March 1. With Lance Scott coming back from a knee injury, the Giants have a quality replacement at center.</p><p>Running back Gary Brown, whose cap number is $1.5 million and who was injured twice, does not fit in any longer. Why? Because the Giants are going to make sure they get the new running back they desperately need, right?</p><p>Wide receiver David Patten is a restricted free agent. If some other team makes a run at him, the Giants should send them a thank-you card. The Giants are pleased with and committed to playing Dan Campbell, the tight end taken in the third round last year, so he will supplant the veteran Howard Cross, who stays on as a cheap, durable reserve.</p><p>If the Giants happen to draft an impact linebacker with their first or second pick -- and get their top-notch running back some other way -- the draft pick will be used to replace the strongside linebacker Ryan Phillips, who faded as the season went on.</p><p>Defensive tackle Robert Harris is a good player, but he has not proved he can stay healthy, and since his cap number is $2.3 million next season, keeping him is a huge gamble. The Giants need pass-rushing help from a set of young legs.</p><p>Safety Sam Garnes, one of the few defensive bright spots this season, will get a new contract. Left tackle Roman Oben, an unrestricted free agent, should be kept in the fold, but the Giants will not chase Oben too far up the salary ladder because Luke Petitgout, the 1999 first-round pick, is a natural left tackle the team has to find a spot for eventually.</p><p>Cornerback Conrad Hamilton, another unrestricted free agent, could stick around to ease the loss of Sparks. There does not seem to be any hope for free safety Percy Ellsworth, unless he is ignored by the rest of the National Football League, which curiously is just about what happened last winter when he was also a free agent.</p><p>In the end, these are not going to be happy meetings at Giants Stadium this week. And that is good news for Giant fans. Those in power on the Giants should be a little ornery.</p><p>Sehorn is right. The Giants need an attitude adjustment. Some new blood would not hurt.</p><p>In five months, with Collins installed as the new spiritual leader on offense, expect the Giants to have a new personality and a new look. And it would start with a new stud of a running back.</p><p>Meeting Set on Fassel's Deal</p><p>Jim Fassel will meet with the Giants' front office today for the first time to discuss a contract extension. The talks should lead to a formal agreement by next week.</p><p>Fassel and General Manager Ernie Accorsi denied yesterday that a deal had been completed, and there appears to be negotiating to do on the extension's length. The team is considering a two-year offer while Fassel is leaning toward three years, said people with knowledge of the discussions. Fassel's contract expires after next season, but neither side wants him to run the team in the final year of his contract.</p><p>''There's been no agreement on any contract extension,'' Fassel said last night. ''But as I've said all along, I've very comfortable with how this organization operates and conducts business.''</p><p>Said Accorsi: ''We haven't met yet. I hope that Jim will be coach for a long time to come.''</p><p>The co-owners, Wellington Mara and Bob Tisch, and the executive vice president, John Mara, are also expected to attend the meeting.</p></body></html>
