<p><strong></strong>Marino, a 17-year N.F.L. veteran, has thrown 17 interceptions this season, 12 of them during a late-season collapse in which Miami lost 5 of 6 games.</p><p>Thus, in this do-or-die atmosphere made even more dramatic by the possibility that one or the other -- or both -- of these celebrated Dolphins will retire, Miami has devised a much simpler plan for the wild-card game than it used late in the regular season.</p><p>''We looked at what we've been successful doing in the last four or five weeks and decided to take that and go with it,'' Marino said this week at the team's practice facility. ''We looked at what we've been successful doing as a group, not necessarily just me.''</p><p>Johnson traces the decline of the Dolphins, who finished 9-7, directly to 19 turnovers in their last 6 games. So he is trying to limit Miami's help to the opposition by simplifying the offense.</p><p>''That's kind of the theme of this week,'' Marino said.</p><p>How far the Dolphins go in the playoffs may depend more on how well they run than on Marino's right arm, which has thrown for more yards than that of any other passer in N.F.L. history.</p><p>Johnson, now in his fourth season with Miami, has been trying without success to establish a running game since he arrived.</p><p>''I think that's the thing that determines success late in the year,'' he said. ''When you're able to run the ball, it takes the weather out of the game. On top of that, I think when teams start the season out, they're able to throw the football, but when teams see what you do best, they're able to devise some coverages that take away a lot of your passing game and give you problems. That's why the safest way to go, is to run the ball.''</p><p>The Dolphins have their fingers crossed about the rookie running back J. J. Johnson, who has a team-leading 558 rushing yards, but is questionable for Sunday with a pulled right hamstring. The coach expects him to practice Friday and start the game.</p><p>If Johnson can not play, the bulk of the running would fall to another rookie, Autry Denson, a significantly more problematic choice for Miami.</p><p>This has been a largely unfulfilling season for Marino, punctuated by a neck injury that sidelined him for six weeks. He returned to a five-interception game against Dallas and Miami's slide began.</p><p>''I probably rushed Dan back in the lineup sooner than what I should've,'' Johnson said. ''He was rusty obviously against Dallas, so we turned the ball over a bunch there, even though we played pretty good defense. Then we lost the next game against Indianapolis. Since that time, I think our confidence has really been shaken. And I think it's been a problem.''</p><p>The coach and his quarterback are trying hard not to think beyond this week. With the specter of retirement in the air, they have been bombarded with questions in recent weeks. The team owner, H. Wayne Huizenga, has said he hopes both return.</p><p>Johnson said he would decide whether to step down once the season is completed. ''You know, nothing ever stays the same and things do change,'' he said. ''We'll just take a look at it when the season is over. I told Wayne I would try to assess everything and then I would make a decision on a yearly basis.'' Marino also said he would evaluate his situation at season's end. The veteran teammate Trace Armstrong, the defensive end, thinks it will be difficult for Marino to walk away from the game.</p><p>''He has tremendous pride in his ability,'' Armstrong said. ''When you take a guy like that with a tremendous passion for the game -- and Jerry Rice and Kevin Greene are a couple of others like that who come to mind -- I don't think those guys are going to go quietly.''</p></body></html>
