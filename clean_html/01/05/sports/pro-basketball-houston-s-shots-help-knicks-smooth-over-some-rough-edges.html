<p><strong></strong>Sometimes, Allan Houston's unassuming style is easily lost amid the no-look passes and unabashed dunks of his more telegenic teammates. On other nights, the serene nature he possesses on the floor is as overpowering as a sunset.</p><p>Houston was in full color last night, a sight impossible to overlook. When the Knicks needed someone to calm the nerves the Celtics tried to jangle, Houston quietly slipped to his mark and delivered a soothing sequence of jumpers for a season-high 37 points, including 14 in the fourth quarter.</p><p>He hit 5 of 6 shots in the final 10 minutes 26 seconds of a game the Celtics tried unsuccessfully to pry from the fingertips of the Knicks.</p><p>Instead, the Celtics lost for the 15th straight time at Madison Square Garden, 96-88, under the spell of Houston.</p><p>''At some point, I just felt like God took over my body,'' said Houston, who finished the night shooting 12 for 18 from the floor and fell only 1 point shy of his career high. ''It's like it's not even me out there.''</p><p>Houston's out-of-body experience left the Celtics devastated. Twice, the Celtics closed within 3 points of the Knicks (19-12) in the last six minutes of the game and each time Houston unfurled a 3-pointer to stop the momentum of the Celtics (13-17). The last one ended the night for good.</p><p>On the play, Larry Johnson, drawing a double-team in the post, looked up to see Houston standing all alone for a 3-point shot at the top of the arc. Once again, Houston had sneaked free to the open spot. Once again, he was there to hit a 3-pointer with 2:57 left in the game that turned a 2-point game into a 90-85 lead. Drained of all hope, the Celtics scored only 3 points the rest of the game.</p><p>''That last 3-pointer really hurt us bad,'' Antoine Walker said. ''We battled hard, but that really hurt us.''</p><p>Hard to believe such pain could be inflicted by the gentle Houston. But with one 37-point effort, an extra All-Star vote could go his way instead going to the flashier guards in the league.</p><p>''I don't think there is any doubt that Allan is an efficient player, but he is certainly not spectacular,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ''He will try his occasional look-away pass to make the highlight reels, but spectacular, for the most part, doesn't win games. Guys like Vince Carter are efficient and spectacular. They're just the rarity. Allan is efficient with his shooting. You don't see too many two-guards shooting 49 percent.''</p><p>The Knicks needed that effort to make up for the vulnerabilities exposed by the Celtics. As usual, the Knicks had trouble guarding Kenny Anderson (22 points) off the dribble.</p><p>And, as usual, they had trouble protecting the ball against the Celtics harassing defense (18 turnovers).</p><p>With a four-day break to steel themselves against the Celtics, the Knicks came out with the right mind-set: Do unto others before they do in you. The Knicks were the aggressors on defense and focused on offense as they built a 13-point, first-quarter lead.</p><p>But once the Celtics began turning the pressure back onto the Knicks, which resulted in seven second-quarter turnovers -- and once they began to penetrate inside to pick up layups and free-throw opportunities, the tone of the game changed.</p><p>The Celtics, down by 12 points with 9:41 left in the half, went on a 23-10 run to end the second quarter with a 50-49 lead. Instead of reacting with an edge to them, the Knicks came out in the third quarter and began settling for jump shots. That plan left the Knicks to start the third 1 for 8 from the field in the first five minutes and left them down, 58-53.</p><p>The Knicks shook up their thinking and started being assertive again. Suddenly, the Knicks were back on top, 59-58, with 5:41 left in the third after a jumper by Houston, a driving layup by Sprewell and a post move from Johnson.</p><p>Then Sprewell, on one of the niftiest plays of the night, raced down the floor on the break and delivered a line-drive, alley-oop pass to Marcus Camby, who handled the pass and the finger roll all at once to put the Knicks up, 66-63, with 3:45 left in the third. As the Knicks approached the fourth quarter, all of the flash the Knicks possessed gave way to the more poetic Houston.</p><p>''I'm not as spectacular, I know,'' Houston said. ''But I used to admire Joe Dumars for the same thing. He didn't do anything spectacular, but no one wanted to guard him.''</p><p>REBOUNDS</p><p>PATRICK EWING ended the night with 16 points and 14 rebounds and was a major part of a defense that held the Celtics to 3 points in the last 3:20. Ewing came up with a blocked shot and two rebounds. . . . Perhaps exhausted in his nightlong pursuit of Paul Pierce, who led the Celtics with 23 points, LATRELL SPREWELL scored 9 of his 15 points in the first quarter. Sprewell began 4 for 6 in the first quarter and ended 7 for 14. . . . The Knicks shot 55 percent while holding the Celtics to 39.5 percent. . . . ALLAN HOUSTON's career high is 38 points, which was set on March 23, 1996, when he was a Detroit Piston. . . . After the New Year's Day birth of his daughter, CRYSTAL ANGEL, CHRIS CHILDS returned to the team with his hospital ID bracelet on as he walked into the locker room last night. ''It's for good luck,'' he said looking a little tired after being by his wife's side during delivery.</p></body></html>
