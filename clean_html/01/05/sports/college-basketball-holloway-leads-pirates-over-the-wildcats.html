<p><strong></strong>In a pleasant romp of a Big East opener tonight, Seton Hall enjoyed a quantifiable and balanced display from its current star, strong scoring contributions from other key players and intriguing but mixed moments from a possible future star.</p><p>The current star is Shaheen Holloway, the senior guard, who scored 16 points, grabbed 8 rebounds and had 10 assists in a 71-64 victory over Villanova in Continental Arena. The victory was the sixth straight for the Pirates, who raised their record to 9-2 while dropping Villanova to 6-4.</p><p>Also contributing for the Pirates were Darius Lane with 21 points, and Rimas Kaukenas with 14. Malik Allen scored 25 points for Villanova, which trailed by 22 points in the second half before cutting the deficit to a respectable margin at the finish.</p><p>But the most interesting player in the game might have been Samuel Dalembert, Seton Hall's 6-foot-11-inch freshman center who made the first start of his career. Although he scored only 3 points and was charged with three fouls and five turnovers, Dalembert was a significant presence, particularly in the first half, when the game was close. He altered action around him and excited the crowd of 9,516. He also blocked three shots and grabbed four rebounds.</p><p>''He changes the game,'' said Holloway, who added that Dalembert will do two good things for every mistake he makes as he learns to play at the college level. ''Sam's got great potential. He can do so much. He's got to stay focused and not worry about mistakes. Once we get him playing consistently, our team will be really good.''</p><p>Tommy Amaker, the Seton Hall coach, said ''the sky's the limit'' for Dalembert, and that is where he seemed to play at times, even altering shots by Allen, a 6-10 senior.</p><p>''If I put pressure on the other team and intimidate and use my quickness on the inside, we can take care of business on the outside,'' Dalembert said, referring to the Pirate shooters, who were 8 of 19 on 3-point attempts.</p><p>Dalembert is as long and lean as the No. 1 that he wears on his uniform. He is from Haiti by way of Montreal and New Jersey. He might have had more points if passes from Holloway had not zipped through his hands for turnovers. ''Some people say I'm too hyper and I should catch it first,'' Dalembert said. ''I have to be ready for the pass.''</p><p>Referring to Holloway, Amaker said: ''We're going to go as far as he is going to take us. He is such a valuable player. He sets the tone with his energy and defense.''</p><p>The Pirates also used fast breaks to good effect after taking 15 turnovers from the Wildcats. ''That's the most fast break points we've had since I've been here,'' Holloway said. ''The key is that everybody is contributing.''</p><p>It was the first conference game for both teams. Seton Hall next plays on Saturday at Georgetown. Villanova plays on Sunday at Penn in a nonconference game.</p><p>Accurate shooting from 3-point range helped give Seton Hall a 34-24 lead at halftime. Lane, Holloway and Kaukenas all were 2 for 4 from this range before the intermission. Villanova scored the first 2 points of the game, but the Pirates surged ahead by 9-2.</p><p>Both teams seemed nervous at first. Villanova had 11 turnovers in the first 20 minutes and Seton Hall had nine. At halftime, Lane had 12 points to lead all scorers. Allen, Villanova's center, had 10 points at halftime, most of them when Dalembert was on the bench.</p><p>Steve Lappas, the coach of Villanova, said the youth of his team might have accounted for the turnovers that led to easy baskets for the home team. ''Four of our eight top guys are freshmen,'' Lappas said. ''We have to find some consistency in those guys. Until we do that, we are going to be up and down.''</p></body></html>
