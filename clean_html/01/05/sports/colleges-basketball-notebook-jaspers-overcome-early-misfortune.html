<p><strong></strong>MANHATTAN</p><p>Manhattan (5-5, 2-0 Metro Atlantic) has already matched its victory total of last season despite a heap of misfortune. On Dec. 5, forward Noah Coughlin scored 22 points in a victory over Niagara and then tore a groin muscle. On Dec. 13, Ken Kavanagh, the Jaspers' leading scorer and rebounder last season, surprised the team by announcing he was quitting to play in Europe. Then Jerry Clark, a freshman guard, followed a season-high 12-point outburst in 10 minutes against Lehigh by tearing his anterior cruciate ligament in practice. To top it off, the Jaspers' best player, Durelle Brown (20.2 points a game), was hampered by a foot injury.</p><p>''I'm just trying to look at the positives,'' Coach Bobby Gonzalez said yesterday at the basketball writers' luncheon in Manhattan.</p><p>The Jaspers play at Siena tomorrow and against Marist on Saturday as part of the M.A.A.C. Challenge tripleheader at Madison Square Garden.</p><p>MARIST</p><p>The Red Foxes may have a 5-6 record (1-1 Metro Atlantic), but who could question their commitment? Five players, including two starters, Tomasz Cielebak and Tom Kenney, are married. Blake Sonne, a reserve guard, became the latest Red Fox to tie the knot, around Thanksgiving.</p><p>''I'm a little concerned after games when I see all their wives when the kid doesn't play so much,'' Coach Dave Magarity said.</p><p>HOFSTRA</p><p>The Flying Dutchmen, showing signs that they will make a serious run at a National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament berth, await the Jan. 14 activation of center Lars Grubler. Grubler, a 6-foot-11-inch freshman, had to sit out the first part of the season because the N.C.A.A. questioned his amateur participation on a professional team in Germany. Grubler adds a bulky inside presence to a team built on quickness.</p><p>''He's going to play minutes,'' the associate head coach Tom Pecora said. ''He's a very smart kid, good feet and hands.''</p><p>FAIRLEIGH DICKINSON</p><p>The Knights (4-5) were averaging an ugly 23 turnovers a game before Coach Tom Green handed the reins of the offense to Lamont Perry. In their last two games, the Knights averaged 14 turnovers.</p><p>''Until last week I was wearing a football helmet to practice,'' Green said.</p><p>ST. PETER'S</p><p>Jermaine Johnson has not been blessed with great talent, but perseverance has turned him into a reliable starter.</p><p>Johnson attended Austin Peay out of Paterson Catholic (N.J.) High School and was redshirted as a freshman in the 1995-96 season. He transferred to St. Peter's the next year, sitting out the entire 1996-97 campaign. He became eligible to play for the Peacocks in the 1997-98 season, but a knee injury limited him to a few minutes in six games. In the 1998-99 season, his highest-scoring game was 11 points.</p><p>The 6-9 Johnson is getting the hang of it in his final year of eligibility. He averages 9 points and 5 rebounds a game as an everyday player.</p><p>HUNTER</p><p>Hunter's Greg Hardin, a senior transfer from St. Louis University, is considered by some to be the Division III City University of New York's most dominant player in more than a decade. Maybe his 30.7 points per game average has something to do with it. As a team, however, Hunter is struggling along at 2-7 (1-2 CUNY).</p><p>REBOUNDS</p><p>Bootsy Thornton, coming off a 12-point, 7-assist, 6-steal performance in a victory over Pittsburgh, will make his 49th consecutive start for St. John's when the Red Storm plays West Virginia in Wheeling on Saturday. St. Francis (5-5) of Brooklyn is riding a 13-game winning streak at home. Monmouth (3-6) has lost to the likes of Princeton, Miami and DePaul, yet maintains the best scoring defense (61 points) in the Northeast Conference. Siena (7-4, 2-0 M.A.A.C.) is enduring a rare three-game losing streak. Yaacov Williams (14.7 points, 9.8 rebounds) and Ryan McCormick (15.4 points, 6.6 assists) are the main reasons that Adelphi is off to a 6-3 start. Wagner (5-3) is forcing an average of 25 turnovers a game. Columbia has not won away from home since last Feb. 5, when the Lions beat Brown. John Jay, led by Andrew Brown (19.5 points), sits atop the CUNY Conference with a 5-0 mark. RON DICKER</p></body></html>
