<p><strong></strong>Bill Belichick was in his office before 5 a.m. yesterday, fretting about his future, literally deciding at the last minute to abandon the Jets. As is often the case, his look was slightly disheveled, but appearances in the National Football League are often not what they seem, especially in this bizarre case of ''Will the Real Jets Head Coach Please Stand Up?'' Belichick may sometimes look like he just rolled out of a washing machine, but he is also brilliant, analytical, and maybe even conniving, and at this point he is also, quite possibly, the next general manager and coach of the New England Patriots.</p><p>Though things could change drastically, and seemingly do by the minute, the Patriots, according to a team executive, are considering making Belichick the director of football operations and head coach. They are considering making Belichick among the five highest-paid coaches in the game. And if necessary, the Patriots' owner, Robert K. Kraft, is prepared to give up draft picks to secure Belichick. That same executive believes if the Patriots did indeed recruit Belichick, it might cost the franchise a first-, second- and third-round pick, though no one knows for certain what the exact compensation might be.</p><p>What we have here, as they like to say in the military, is a situation. A weird, Twilight Zone-type of deal, in which the Patriots might be sending the Jets draft picks as compensation for the rights to Belichick in much the same way that the Jets, three years ago, sent New England first-, second-, third- and fourth-round selections over three drafts as compensation for Bill Parcells.</p><p>Another day, another feud between the Jets and Patriots and, along with it, more hatred between Parcells and Kraft. Not only may Kraft try to steal Parcells's former right-hand man, he might have help from Belichick himself while doing it. And the man who again could be called upon to sort out what may end up as a terrific mess is N.F.L. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, the great pacifier, who can get feuding owners into his office and have people walking out feeling as if they won something.</p><p>Kraft wants Belichick in the worst way. He thinks Belichick is the missing piece that can get New England back to the Super Bowl.</p><p>Someone else on the Patriots also likes Belichick, according to a team executive. Quarterback Drew Bledsoe had a good relationship with Belichick when the latter was a Patriots assistant in 1996, when they won the A.F.C. championship. And Kraft has a relationship with Bledsoe that is similar to the one that the Dallas owner Jerry Jones has with quarterback Troy Aikman, who owns an inordinate amount of say, for a player, on how the organization should be run. Bledsoe has just as much input and would be very happy if Belichick ended up in New England.</p><p>Of course, to paraphrase Belichick's words yesterday, there are so many uncertainties, it is impossible to tell what will happen. Some in the Patriots organization, directly contradicting others, are quick to point out that any suggestion stating Belichick's arrival in New England is imminent is completely exaggerated. As proof, they pointed to the fact that yesterday the Patriots asked permission to speak with the Denver Broncos' offensive coordinator, Gary Kubiak, who then told the Patriots he was not interested.</p><p>If the Patriots wanted Belichick so badly, these team officials said, why begin the interview process with Kubiak and others? Another person in the Patriots organization said he was concerned about Belichick's at times rambling, and even unnerving, remarks to reporters yesterday.</p><p>But is all of this simply a great game of poker?</p><p>After all, why would someone like Belichick, who weighs everything in his life very carefully, leave a head-coaching job with nothing else in hand? It is hard to believe that Belichick would abandon a prestigious position that paid over $1 million a year on a team that has a chance to make it to the Super Bowl unless he knew that another such position, a possibly better position, one that did not include the meddlesome Parcells, existed. And Belichick's intentions to coach next year, wherever that may be, became fairly clear when it was announced late Tuesday that his lawyer planned to file a grievance with the N.F.L. over his Jets contract.</p><p>Kraft would never risk violating the league's tampering rules by speaking directly with Belichick, since Belichick is under contract with the Jets for three more years. But as happens every day in professional football, a message can be sent covertly, not exactly breaking the tampering rules, but bending them a little. Belichick could have been contacted through back channels and been given promises on behalf of Kraft.</p><p>Belichick's contract has been more scrutinized than a Donald Trump prenuptial agreement. The man with the biggest microscope has been Jets President Steve Gutman, who, when it comes to contracts, misses nothing. The league has also reviewed it, and it is ironclad. Belichick is not getting out of it. So the question becomes: Will Kraft give up draft picks to get Belichick? The answer is probably.</p><p>The Jets' hierarchy is so embarrassed and infuriated, that if team officials could, they would prevent anyone from ever again speaking Belichick's name, a sort of Gang Green curse. After less than 24 hours, his head-coaching career in New York is over. But in New England, it might just be beginning.</p></body></html>
