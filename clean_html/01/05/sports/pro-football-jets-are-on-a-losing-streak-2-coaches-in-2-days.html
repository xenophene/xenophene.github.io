<p><strong></strong>One day after he was named to succeed Bill Parcells as the Jets' head coach, Bill Belichick made a sudden reversal today and resigned instead. Belichick informed the team of his decision only minutes before a news conference intended to introduce him as the new coach.</p><p>It made for a bizarre scene at the Jets' training complex here, with Belichick delivering a rambling monologue on his decision while surprised team officials and reporters looked on. On Monday the Jets had trumpeted his appointment as a sign of stability and continuity in the wake of Parcells's retirement. Today the team appeared in disarray, with neither Belichick nor Parcells as coach.</p><p>The development at least raised the possibility that Parcells might return as coach, though he said on Monday that his coaching career was over. But that was before Belichick made his turnaround. Parcells was not available for comment today, and the team's president, Steve Gutman, declined to speculate on anything about the future.</p><p>Without being specific, Belichick cited the uncertainty over the team's ownership status as the main reason for his decision. The team is being sold by the estate of the late Leon Hess, and two bidders are in the running, both with offers of more than $600 million. A winner is expected to be named soon, possibly by the end of this week.</p><p>''I just don't feel at this time I can lead the Jets with a 100 percent conviction,'' he said. ''There are a number of uncertainties that would affect a head-coaching job -- the new owner, Bill's future.</p><p>''On Monday Bill said to me, 'If you feel that undecided, maybe you shouldn't take this job.' ''</p><p>Belichick's stint at the podium was followed by Gutman, who tried to conceal his anger at what he had just heard.</p><p>''I think we listened for an hour and a half to someone in turmoil,'' he said.</p><p>Belichick, 47, declined to discuss whether he would seek a job with another team, and in fact he is prevented from doing so by his contract with the Jets. But the team may be facing a protracted fight over Belichick's status. Belichick's lawyer, Neil Cornrich of Cleveland, notified the National Football League that Belichick would file a grievance on Wednesday to void his contract.</p><p>Presumably, that would pave the way to his being interviewed by the New England Patriots, who on Monday dismissed their coach, Pete Carroll, while at the same time requesting permission to speak to Belichick about the job. The Jets turned down the request on the basis that Belichick had succeeded Parcells after Sunday's game. The league upheld the Jets' contention that Belichick was off limits to any other team, and reaffirmed that position in a statement today.</p><p>The situation is reminiscent of one three years ago when Parcells wanted to leave the Patriots to coach the Jets. The N.F.L. commissioner, Paul Tagliabue, had to mediate a settlement to allow Parcells's move, with the Jets providing draft picks to New England in return.</p><p>It is possible, perhaps likely, that Tagliabue will again have to intercede if the Patriots want to hire Belichick. The Jets say they will hold Belichick to his contract, but may end up negotiating a settlement that would bring them draft choices.</p><p>In a 55-minute discourse in the team's auditorium today, Belichick said he had felt uneasy with his appointment and had thought hard about it as he ran on a treadmill at the Jets' complex late this morning. He returned to his office and scribbled out a resignation that he delivered to Gutman five minutes before the news conference.</p><p>''Due to the various uncertainties surrounding my position as it relates to the team's new ownership,'' it started, ''I have decided to resign as the HC of the N.Y. Jets.''</p><p>In his comments, Belichick implied that his Jets contract might be invalid because it was signed with Hess, the team's late owner, and because there might also have been a change in his status working under Parcells. ''I understand that I have a contract,'' he said. ''I understand that there are rules and interpretations of the contract.''</p><p>He would not be pinned down on the possibility of joining another team. But he signaled his intentions later when Cornrich informed the league of Belichick's plan to protest his contract.</p><p>Long a highly regarded defensive coordinator, Belichick served a five-year stint as the Browns' head coach with mixed results, and he acknowledged that he was concerned about being in a safe haven as a coach.</p><p>There was uncertainty in Cleveland, which lost the franchise to Baltimore after the 1995 season. He was fired a few months later.</p><p>Of that time, he said, ''I've been in a situation and, more importantly, my family has been in a situation where I was the head coach of a team in transition, of a team that went through a lot of changes, and frankly it wasn't a real good experience for me or them.''</p><p>Belichick also expressed reservations about the club's stability under the new ownership, and pointed out that the process had gone weeks past what he had been told was the likely sale date.</p><p>Though he has been a valued right-hand man to Parcells for almost two decades, Belichick hinted at a weariness of his close association with the dominating Parcells. He mentioned his inability to make his views known publicly, a reference to Parcells's policy of not letting his assistants be interviewed; he also said he had learned to turn a deaf ear to what he said were Parcells's yearly proclamations that he was ready to turn things over to Belichick.</p><p>Then he also implied that he did not know what his role would be under Parcells, a likely Hall of Fame coach whose future with the Jets was up in the air. Parcells had promised to act as an adviser rather than as head of the Jets' football operations, which is his title, but had Parcells stayed on, Belichick would have been coaching in his shadow.</p><p>''Here we go again,'' the outspoken wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson said when he learned the news. ''More uncertainty in the organization. My fourth head coach in four years.'' Actually, Johnson has had two head coaches, but Belichick would be the third and his replacement the fourth.</p><p>Parcells resigned on Monday, a day after the Jets ended an 8-8 season with a fourth straight victory and could look forward to next season with a core of very good players. The move elevated Belichick to the Jets' head-coaching post because of a contract he had signed in 1997 when he and Parcells helped remake the Jets. The contract calls for Belichick to take over when Parcells resigned.</p><p>Thus, Belichick never had the option of deciding whether he wanted to coach in New England or here.</p><p>He would not say if anger over the situation regarding the Patriots had caused his resignation, instead repeatedly using the word ''uncertainty'' to describe the state of the team as his major reason.</p><p>The Patriots, meanwhile, declined to comment. A club spokesman said: ''This is clearly a Jets matter. We can't comment on anyone we don't have permission to speak to.''</p><p>One of the Jets' highly regarded assistants, Romeo Crennel, who coaches the defensive line, said he was standing in a hallway with the linebackers coach Al Groh waiting for Belichick's speech.</p><p>''Bill walked past and said, 'I'm going to resign,' '' Crennel said. ''That was a shock.''</p><p>It is uncertain who will take over now. It is likely that team officials will wait for the new ownership to be in place before hiring a new coach. The Jets have one assistant with head-coaching experience, the quarterbacks coach Dan Henning.</p><p>And they still have Parcells, who asserted on Monday that his coaching was over. But another assistant, Pat Hodgson, wasn't so sure.</p><p>''I'm sure Big Bill will have to step back in here and pull everything back together,'' he said. The coaches refer to Belichick as Little Bill and Parcells as Big Bill. Now there is only Big Bill. With Belichick gone, there is more work for him to do.</p></body></html>
