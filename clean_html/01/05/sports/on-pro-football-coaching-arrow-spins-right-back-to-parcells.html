<p><strong></strong>Three years ago, Bill Belichick was the Jets' head coach for one week. It was simply a ploy. He held the seat warm until Bill Parcells could be freed from the New England Patriots and then Belichick took his customary role as defensive coordinator.</p><p>On Monday, Parcells resigned as the Jets' coach and Belichick took over for what turned out to be one day. There was nothing coy this time, no type of ploy at work, or so the Jets' management and players thought.</p><p>But yesterday, Belichick balked. He resigned before one team meeting, before one practice as the Jets' head coach. He sees greener pastures, especially in New England. He wants to be a free-agent coach. Shop around. Start his own thing, a new thing.</p><p>The Jets should oblige.</p><p>There is absolutely no way the Jets should try to force Belichick to coach a team he does not want to coach. Do you think the players would respond to that?</p><p>Here is a coach who for three years has preached to the Jets' defensive players about loyalty and commitment and excellence. And now, with a chance to lead them all, he scoots? Do you think the players are not smart enough to recognize that they have been indirectly scorned?</p><p>For certain, Belichick did not mean for it to be this way. But, nonetheless, that is the result. The Jets should cut their losses, take the draft choices as compensation that will truly come their way by letting Belichick flee, and move forward.</p><p>This entire scenario was befuddling from the start.</p><p>Parcells leaves New England for the Jets and the Jets are forced to award draft choices as compensation to New England. Parcells signs a contract with Leon Hess, then the Jets' owner, which says Belichick will take over once Parcells quits. Belichick agrees and reportedly accepts more than $1.4 million to follow through. Hess dies. The team goes up for sale. Parcells quits. Now, Belichick quits, too.</p><p>The Jets' new ownership is supposed to be in place in a matter of days. Whoever heard of an owner spending more than $600 million for a team with a brand-new coach already named? It was absurd from the start, and now it is even more absurd.</p><p>Jets players were stunned yesterday. For the second time. First Parcells exits, and a day later, Belichick.</p><p>One Jet, who spoke on the condition that his name not be publicized, said: ''Coach Parcells has always run his own ship and has no problem voicing his opinion to players, coaches, anybody. He had his run-ins with Belichick over the defense this year, but I assumed that was nothing out of the ordinary; they've been together a long time. But it is hard for me to believe that Coach Parcells could step away from leadership cold turkey and just be some kind of adviser. I don't think it would have worked with him and Belichick in that kind of role. I never sensed that Belichick was unhappy. But you wouldn't know it, anyway, because he doesn't talk that much.''</p><p>Here are the reasons Belichick is a coveted man in the National Football League: He is a man of extreme and intricate detail. His game plans are superb. His ability to adjust on the fly during games is even more impressive.</p><p>His drawbacks have always been communication -- especially mastering the nuances of communication that is required by N.F.L. head coaches with players, management, reporters and fans. That was one of the issues that caused his firing from his only N.F.L. head-coaching job, in Cleveland. But that was almost five years ago. Since then, Belichick has worked at refurbishing his image.</p><p>And it has worked. N.F.L. teams are interested. The Jets were, too.</p><p>But Belichick must now be freed by the Jets for a healthy price. Then the Jets can ask Parcells to return. That is the first choice.</p><p>Parcells indicated that if the Jets had not recovered from their season-opening slide that it would have been harder for him to retire. They did recover, finishing 8-8 with a 7-2 record in their last nine games. Now they are in leadership chaos. If there was ever a scenario for Parcells to return and keep the ship upright, this is it.</p><p>Dan Henning, now on the Jets' staff as the quarterbacks coach, could also do the job, as could Romeo Crennel, the defensive line coach and a longtime Parcells assistant. Mike Martz, the St. Louis Rams' offensive coordinator, deserves a look as a head coach, too. And there are several qualified N.F.L. assistants -- Terry Robiskie in Washington, Dom Capers in Jacksonville, a young, bright mind like Steve Brown from the Rams -- who could lead the Jets as well.</p><p>Fans on Sunday chanted ''One more year!'' for Parcells. Could he? Would he? Like Belichick, if he really does not want it, he should not take it.</p><p>What, then, do the Jets do if they can't entice Parcells? Simple: play out the compensation string with Belichick and then find a new man.</p></body></html>
