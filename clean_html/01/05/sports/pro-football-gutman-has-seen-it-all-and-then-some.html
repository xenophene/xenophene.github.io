<p><strong></strong>Since 1977, Steve Gutman had been through all those bizarre Jets moments, including Walt Michaels screaming over the telephone at someone he thought was Al Davis and the players' strike when picketers spit at Mark Gastineau.</p><p>Add today to that list.</p><p>Gutman, president of the Jets, was waiting at the team's offices for a 2:30 p.m. news conference during which Bill Belichick would ascend the podium as the team's latest head coach. The assistant coach, known as the best defensive mind in football, was the hand-picked successor to Bill Parcells, who had resigned on Monday. But five minutes before the news conference was scheduled to begin, Belichick said he had to see Gutman first.</p><p>In Gutman's office, Belichick handed the team president a piece of paper on which he had written his brief resignation note. Belichick then went to the auditorium that held about half the crowd that had turned out for Parcells's resignation announcement the previous day.</p><p>Gutman watched without expression as Belichick listed his reasons for not taking the head-coaching job and implied that his contract, which has him signed with the Jets in some capacity for the next three years, might be invalid because the team owner, Leon Hess, had died.</p><p>Gutman shook Belichick's hand when the coach left the podium.</p><p>''Obviously I'm very surprised and disappointed,'' Gutman said after Belichick left.</p><p>But Gutman also said that the contract, which calls for Belichick to succeed Parcells, had been modified ''at least five times'' since Belichick signed it in 1997.</p><p>Gutman claimed the contract covered ownership changes, head-coaching responsibilities and Parcells's noncoaching duties. According to him, the ''contracts are unambiguous.''</p><p>Of the resignation, Gutman said: ''It will have an incalculable effect. I think we listened for an hour and a half to someone in turmoil.''</p><p>Belichick said he had written his note after spending an hour on a treadmill. He had been exercising alongside Kevin Williams, a Jets defensive back who had been hospitalized after a serious infection during the season. Williams had undergone three surgical procedures.</p><p>Belichick described his feelings being next to Williams, of looking out at the practice field, as solidifying his desire to quit.</p><p>The coach said he then wrote out his resignation letter in longhand. ''I don't know how to use a computer,'' he said.</p><p>Gutman later read the note in its entirety, using the abbreviated letters -- like H.C. for head coach -- Belichick had used.</p><p>Had Gutman experienced anything like this before? ''This doesn't remind me of anything that has happened to me in my life,'' he said. ''If it had, I wouldn't be here now.''</p></body></html>
