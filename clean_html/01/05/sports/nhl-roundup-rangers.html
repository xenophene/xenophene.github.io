<p><strong></strong>The Rangers are without a victory in their last seven games (0-4-3) and going nowhere fast.</p><p>Even though they have been averaging a shade over two goals a game during the drought, their coach, John Muckler, is toying with the idea of dressing seven defensemen tonight at Madison Square Garden when the Rangers begin a home-and-home series with Toronto , which has the best record in the Eastern Conference.</p><p>Muckler thinks some of his defensemen, the pairing of the rookie Kim Johnsson and the veteran Stephane Quintal in particular, have looked tired lately.</p><p>Johnsson's struggling, Muckler said late Monday night. Quintal's struggling.</p><p>Both were a minus-3 in Monday's 5-2 loss to the St. Louis Blues.</p><p>But all of the Rangers' defensemen are beginning to sag as they await Brian Leetch's return from a broken right forearm.</p><p>Leetch is scheduled to have his arm examined again today, and the Rangers are hoping Leetch can rid himself of his short cast.</p><p>Leetch has been out since Nov. 24, when he broke the ulna bone blocking a shot in Tampa, Fla. In Leetch's absence, the Rangers initially put together a brief spurt from Dec. 3 to Dec. 19, going 5-1-1, but his prolonged absence is beginning to take its toll and the Rangers have a difficult schedule this month.</p><p>So Muckler is considering dressing Jason Doig, who has not played since Nov. 26, to augment the Rangers' defensive corps.</p><p>That, of course, does not help the Rangers' anemic offense. Muckler is tinkering with that, too. He will probably employ a Czech line tonight, moving the newly acquired Radek Dvorak up to play with his countrymen, the struggling Petr Nedved and Jan Hlavac.</p><p>Nedved, who did have a power-play assist Monday night, has gone 12 games without a goal.</p><p>Even though he played one of his better recent games Monday, Nedved was booed nearly every time he touched the puck.
