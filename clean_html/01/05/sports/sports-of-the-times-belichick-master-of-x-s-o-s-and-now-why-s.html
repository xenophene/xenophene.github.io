<p><strong></strong>There are three shadows hanging over Bill Belichick.</p><p>The first shadow comes from the past, from Art Modell, who used Belichick in those last ugly days in Cleveland and then never invited him on the moving van to Baltimore.</p><p>The second shadow comes from the future, from Charles Dolan, or whoever buys the New York Jets.</p><p>The third shadow blots out the light -- morning, noon and afternoon -- and is not going away. That ongoing shadow belonged to Bill Parcells, the once and maybe even future coach of the Jets, and it caused Belichick to commit one of the most shocking resignations in the history of sports today.</p><p>Other coaches have quit impetuously, but Belichick elevated his departure into an earthquake, seemingly out of nowhere. He informed club officials literally minutes before he walked into a news conference that was supposed to have been his introduction as the Jets' new head coach.</p><p>Belichick is going to be vilified by Jets fans and admirers of Parcells, and surely there are no innocents here, since Belichick is about to take legal action with the National Football League to break his contract. It is also true that Belichick has reason to feel his world changed when Leon Hess died last May 7, and then again on Monday when the Jets suddenly made him head coach, to ward off interest from New England. That mousetrap block left Belichick very much in the looming shadow of Bill Parcells.</p><p>Belichick took the high road, talking about ''uncertainties'' with the franchise, soon to be sold by the Hess estate. He spoke with reverence of ''Mr. Hess,'' and with apparent fondness for Parcells.</p><p>''I have talked to Bill for the umpteenth time,'' Belichick said, referring to Parcells's frequent talk of retiring.</p><p>''I took it with a grain of salt,'' Belichick said.</p><p>He knows Parcells as well as almost anybody, having spent years with Parcells hurling objects and invective at his assistants while goading them to win. Inevitably, Belichick was seen as Parcells's acolyte, the brainy defensive assistant who helped the Giants win two Super Bowls and helped the Patriots reach the Super Bowl.</p><p>Belichick is that most rare pro football bird, a graduate of Phillips Andover Academy and Wesleyan College, who learned the game from his father, Steve, a longtime assistant at the Naval Academy. His wife, Debby, and their three children endured the fans' insults during the last year of Modell's denials in Cleveland. When Belichick followed Parcells to New England, the family bought a home in Nantucket, and began to dream of stability.</p><p>''My wife has been pretty thrifty,'' Belichick said. ''She's clipped some coupons. We can get by for a while.''</p><p>As much as they liked New England, Belichick came to the Jets as the man who would be the head coach as soon as Parcells had enough. The question was, would Parcells ever have enough?</p><p>Belichick is an X's and O's guy who spends 12 to 16 hours a day in the bunker. On Monday he felt himself hemmed in by defenses as taut as any of his own.</p><p>The Patriots were firing Pete Carroll and wanted to speak to Belichick, which was their legal right as long as he was still an assistant. They were going to offer more power than Belichick might ever have with the Jets, no matter who owned them.</p><p>Parcells, who had done a superb job of pulling the team together and who had more color in his face than a year ago, suddenly had a motive for not coaching. After a whirl of negotiations, Parcells agreed to stay on as something called ''the head of football operations.''</p><p>It was clear from listening to his words today that Belichick had huge problems with that scenario. A new owner would walk in on the first day and want to ask a few questions about his expensive new toy. Who would be the first person he would consult? A two-time Super Bowl winner. Without any bad will on Parcells's part, Belichick would still be the acolyte.</p><p>The two men spoke on Monday, in an atmosphere that may have been somewhat less than friendly, although Belichick put a positive public spin on it.</p><p>''Bill said, 'I don't know what my role will be,' '' Belichick said. ''Bill's been great. He told me, 'If you feel that undecided, maybe you shouldn't take this job.' I took Bill's words to heart.''</p><p>Today Belichick insisted he was not breaking a contract, saying: ''The understanding I had was with Mr. Hess. The situation has changed.''</p><p>Asked if he could coach anywhere else, Belichick said, ''I'm no lawyer, but there are plenty of them and I'll let them deal with that, but I have a lawyer talking to the league.''</p><p>Steve Gutman, who has been running the Jets for the Hess estate, had been standing jovially in the doorway when he was suddenly informed that Belichick was leaving. Later, after hearing Belichick's explanation, Gutman said Belichick's contract was ''clear, meticulous, unimpeachable, unambiguous.''</p><p>''The uncertainty of his family I can't address,'' Gutman said. ''He's obviously in some turmoil.''</p><p>Gutman asserted that Belichick could not coach anywhere for three years, but there remains the question of whether Belichick could be a general manager in New England, doodling a few defenses and sending them to his coaches.</p><p>Belichick clearly wants to coach again, but not in the shadow of an owner he never anticipated, and not in the shadow of a mentor who shows no signs of going away.</p></body></html>
