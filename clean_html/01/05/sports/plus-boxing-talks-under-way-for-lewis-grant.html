<p><strong></strong>Lennox Lewis, undisputed heavyweight champion of the world, is going from the past to the future. Negotiations are under way to match Lewis against Michael Grant, the No. 2-ranked contender in the International Boxing Federation, on April 29 at Madison Square Garden.</p><p>Milton Chwasky, Lewis's attorney, said that negotiations are still going on between the boxer and HBO, which would broadcast the bout. Chwasky would not discuss the impediments to getting the deal done. If the negotiations are successful, it will be Lewis's first defense of the titles that he won when he defeated Evander Holyfield on Nov. 13.</p><p>Grant, a 26-year-old heavyweight contender with a 31-0 record, is viewed by many in boxing to be the next dominant heavyweight champion. In his last fight against Andrew Golota, Grant came back from two knockdowns to stop Golota on a technical knockout in the 10th round.</p><p>It would be a bout between two of the tallest heavyweights in the sport. Lewis is 6 feet 6 inches, and Grant is 6-7. TIMOTHY W. SMITH</p></body></html>
