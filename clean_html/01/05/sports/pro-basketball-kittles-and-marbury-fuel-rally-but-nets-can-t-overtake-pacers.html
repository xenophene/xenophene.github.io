<p><strong></strong>The Nets marched into the sparkling new yet retro Conseco Fieldhouse tonight minus a starter and still shot a season-high 51.9 percent against the surging Indiana Pacers.</p><p>The Nets' starting guards, Stephon Marbury and Kerry Kittles, were superb, combining for 59 points in an energetic display of athleticism and explosiveness.</p><p>Johnny Newman scored 16 points to fill in admirably for the injured Kendall Gill, who watched the game from the locker room while nursing a sore neck. And the Nets scored more points than all but one other Indiana opponent this season.</p><p>But Coach Don Casey would have given back much of his team's potent offensive attack for a hint of ferociousness on defense. Almost totally ineffective in protecting the basket, the Nets allowed Indiana to shoot 56.3 percent and score 22 points off offensive rebounds en route to winning the Pacers' 10th consecutive game at their new-sprung facility.</p><p>The Pacers won by 116-111 but the score was deceptive. It was so close at the end because of a courageous, though ultimately irrelevant run by the Nets over the final five minutes. With 5 minutes 30 seconds left, the Pacers, who never trailed, led by 20 points.</p><p>''We just didn't do a good job of defending those guys,'' said Kittles, who led everyone with a season-high 33 points and five steals. ''That's pretty much it.''</p><p>The Nets (12-19) saw their four-game winning streak vanish and their unsightly road record decline to 2-11. Indiana, the winner of six consecutive games, improved to 21-9 over all and 13-2 at home.</p><p>Reggie Miller led the Pacers with 24 points, despite being ejected in the third quarter, and Rik Smits, hitting numerous outside shots, followed with 22. Jalen Rose added 19 points, and the reserve forward Austin Croshere (16 points) teamed with Dale Davis to dominate the Nets near the basket.</p><p>With Keith Van Horn struggling through one of his worst games of the season -- 11 points, 1 rebound, 7 turnovers, all in the first half -- the Nets were forced to lean hard on Kittles and Marbury, and both players were up to the task.</p><p>Kittles drove fiercely to the basket in earning 15 free-throw attempts (he made 13), and Marbury played a terrific game, despite tendinitis in both hamstrings. Marbury, who attributed the soreness in his legs to overly exuberant weight lifting on Sunday, recorded 26 points and 10 assists.</p><p>The Nets fell out of close contention midway through the second quarter, when Casey subbed for his starting guards. Down by 39-37 when Elliot Perry and Lucious Harris replaced Marbury and Kittles with 6:52 left in the half, the Nets trailed by 50-39 three minutes later. Casey went back to his top backcourt but by then it was too late, and Indiana, full of momentum, built a 63-45 halftime lead.</p><p>Kittles and Newman rallied the Nets in the third quarter, pulling them within 78-69, and New Jersey seemed to get a break when Miller was ejected for mocking Referee Ronnie Nunn with 4:12 left in the quarter. After hitting a beautiful 20-footer following two head-fakes on Kittles, Miller, thinking he was fouled, shouted at Nunn, who responded by giving him a technical foul. Miller derisively applauded Nunn's technical and was hit with a second technical and automatically ejected.</p><p>When Kittles drained the two free throws to make it 80-71, it seemed to be a new game. But Indiana outscored the Nets, 14-6, over the remainder of the quarter and moved ahead by 108-88 midway through the fourth.</p><p>Casey removed Van Horn, Marbury and Jamie Feick, and the unit of Kittles, Perry, Newman, Scott Burrell and the rookie Evan Eschmeyer (seeing his first action of the season) put together a surprising rally, chopping a 108-91 deficit to 112-107 with 46.9 seconds left.</p><p>At that point, it seemed logical for Casey to reinsert Marbury and perhaps Van Horn, but he opted against it. On top of that, the Nets allowed 10 seconds to tick away before fouling Rose, who made 1 of 2 free throws with 36 seconds left. The Nets could not pull closer, despite Indiana's making only 3 of 6 foul shots in the final 26 seconds.</p><p>In explaining why he kept Marbury on the bench, Casey said: ''There was no thinking to it. We just played who hustled and got us back. We rewarded the team that put us where we were. We thought they were the best players at that moment on the floor.''</p><p>When asked if he wanted to go into the game during the waning moments, Marbury, who showed no hint of contempt on the bench, said, ''No comment.''</p></body></html>
