<p><strong></strong>BRUINS 7, ISLANDERS 3</p><p>The question going into the Islanders' game last night with the Boston Bruins was how well the rookie Roberto Luongo would handle coming back from giving up nine goals in his last start.</p><p>The answer was, not very well.</p><p>After stopping 77 of the 78 shots he had faced in his two victories over the Bruins, a suddenly shaky Luongo turned back only 23 of 30 shots as the Islanders lost their fourth straight, 7-3, before 7,403 at a leaky Nassau Coliseum, where water was dripping from a roof beam onto some fans.</p><p>Luongo, who shut out the Bruins in the last meeting between the two teams, was even leakier.</p><p>Leading by 3-2 late in the second period, the Bruins scored four straight goals, starting with P.J. Axelsson's second of the evening, a shot from just inside the blue line that whistled past Luongo's glove at 19 minutes 4 seconds of the period. Joe Thornton, Jason Allison and Anson Carter, who also scored two goals, all got past Luongo in the third period before Bill Muckalt got the final Islander goal.</p><p>''We knew when we asked Roberto to be our goalie there would be nights he wouldn't be at his best,'' Islanders Coach Butch Goring said. He said he gave some thought to pulling Luongo in the third period, ''but he's got to learn to battle tough situations.''</p><p>Luongo, whose goals against mark soared from 2.23 before the Pittsburgh game to 3.38 after last night's game, said he wasn't sure if the 9-3 loss to the Penguins had had any lingering effects.</p><p>''One thing is for sure -- I didn't feel good in there tonight,'' said Luongo after the team had a long closed-door meeting in the locker room with Goring.</p><p>The Islanders (9-23-5) travel to Philadelphia tomorrow before meeting the Bruins Saturday in Boston in the final game between the clubs this season.</p><p>Discussions inside and outside both locker rooms before the game focused on Gino Odjick's suspension, which was the second-longest handed out this season by the N.H.L.</p><p>''I thought Darius Kasparaitis went out of his way to hit the guy,'' Odjick said about the shot the Pittsburgh right wing took at the Islanders' 18-year-old Tim Connolly last week. Odjick sat out last night's game as the second game of the eight-game suspension he received for hitting Kasparaitis.</p><p>''I don't condone what Gino did,'' said Boston defenseman Marty McSorley. ''But there's not the opportunity for players to police themselves. And without that, there's less respect. The rules handcuff the players. What you have now are players who make certain players play down to their level without the threat of someone being able to do something.''

(AP)</p><p>CAPITALS 6, CANADIENS 1</p><p>Sergei Gonchar recorded his first career hat trick and host Washington staged its most prolific offensive performance of the season in a rout of Montreal.</p><p>Gonchar, who had three goals in his first 31 games this season, doubled that in the opening 31 minutes. It marked only the second time in franchise history that a defenseman scored three goals; Kevin Hatcher did it in 1993 against the Rangers.</p><p>Gonchar, now in his sixth N.H.L. season, had gone 322 games without a hat trick. He also had an assist on a third-period goal that gave the Capitals six in a game for the first time this season.</p><p>Olaf Kolzig had 34 saves for Washington. (AP)</p><p>SENATORS 2, HURRICANES 1</p><p>Shaun Van Allen scored a short-handed goal early in the third period as visiting Ottawa broke a 10-game road streak without a victory against Carolina.</p><p>Ottawa improved to 13-1-3 when leading after two periods and closed to within 6 points of Northeast Division-leading Toronto as the season's halfway point nears.</p><p>Van Allen's fifth goal of the season came a minute and a half after Carolina's Ron Francis tied the score, 1-1, with a power-play goal 23 seconds into the third.</p><p>But a short time later, Van Allen was able to beat Arturs Irbe for Ottawa's third short-handed goal of the season. (AP)</p><p>COYOTES 5, RED WINGS 2</p><p>Shane Doan had two goals and an assist and the relief goalie Robert Esche made 25 saves for his first career victory as visiting Phoenix beat Detroit.</p><p>Juha Ylonen, Jeremy Roenick and Rick Tocchet also scored for the Coyotes, who improved their N.H.L.-best marks for road victories (12) and points (26) with their fourth straight victory in Joe Louis Arena.</p><p>Larry Murphy and Steve Duchesne scored for the Red Wings, who lost their second straight and had a seven-game home unbeaten streak snapped.</p><p>Esche replaced starter Bob Essensa, who strained a hamstring, right after Murphy gave the Red Wings a 1-0 lead late in the first period. Phoenix scored the next four goals, and Esche stymied the Red Wings. (AP)</p><p>BLUES 2, KINGS 2</p><p>Luc Robitaille scored in his 1,000th career game as visiting Los Angeles tied St. Louis.</p><p>The Kings ended the 15-game scoring streak of Pierre Turgeon, whose run is tied for the longest of the season with Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr. Turgeon had 7 goals and 17 assists during the stretch.</p><p>Robitaille's 533rd career goal, tying him with Frank Mahovlich for 20th place on the career list, gave the Kings a 2-1 lead at 51 seconds of the third. The Kings lost one of their stars before the game began when Ziggy Palffy was scratched due to back spasms. (AP)</p><p>OTTAWA</p><p>Vaclav Prospal of the Senators apologized yesterday to French-Canadians for using an ethnic slur against Patrice Brisebois of the Montreal Canadiens. But he refused to apologize to Brisebois.</p><p>Brisebois, who is French-Canadian, said Prospal used an offensive term against him during a 4-4 tie in Ottawa on Dec. 27.</p><p>He said the slur was preceded by an obscenity.</p><p>Prospal, who is Czech, said before his team's game last night against the Carolina Hurricanes that he did not know the remark was an insult.</p><p>''I said it in the heat of the moment,'' he said. ''That was the first thing that came to my mind. For the seven years I have been in America, what I learned was every time you make fun of French guys or something you would say that. I guess I really didn't understand that was a racial comment.''(AP)</p></body></html>
