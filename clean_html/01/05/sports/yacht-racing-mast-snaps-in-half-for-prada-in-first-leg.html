<p><strong></strong>What began with a thriller of a start soon ended with a bang and with expensive fragments of carbon flying through the clear skies above the Hauraki Gulf.</p><p>Equipment has been the big loser since the America's Cup challenger series began in Auckland in October, and not just the split hull of former contender Young America. There have been many technical problems, many breakdowns, and today's high-profile, well-funded victim was the Prada Challenge.</p><p>In the middle of gaining ground against America One on the first leg of their race in this semifinal round, the Italian boat's mast snapped in half, putting a stunningly quick end to a duel that might well have come down to the final jibe.</p><p>Prada, whose $50 million budget is the biggest of the six semifinalists, had been one of the few syndicates to escape major damage here as it put together the best aggregate record among the challengers in the three preliminary rounds. In three years of testing, training and racing, it had never snapped a mast. But it now has a losing record (1-2) in this six-team semifinal round, which will winnow the challenger field to two for the right to challenge New Zealand for the cup next month.</p><p>And as skipper Paul Cayard and the San Francisco-based crew of America One sailed the final five legs of the course alone, Prada's boat, ITA-45, was towed back to the Viaduct Basin, looking more like a square-rigged junk than an America's Cup sloop, its sail folded on top of itself on the now-truncated mast.</p><p>What made the snapped mast all the more surprising was that the weather bore little resemblance to Monday's squall-filled, windy conditions or to the more daunting conditions on Tuesday that forced racing to be canceled. When the first of today's three races began in brilliant sunlight, the wind was blowing at approximately 11 knots, and when Prada's mast snapped in the midst of a starboard tack in slightly choppy conditions, it had increased very little and was well within the safety guidelines.</p><p>''There must have been a flaw in something there,'' Cayard said. ''It wasn't that windy: about 15 knots. I don't know if it was a defect or them pushing the design. They are pushing pretty hard on the Prada boat to keep everything light. They have thin rigging, they are really into reduction. Maybe they pushed it a bit too hard.''</p><p>According to Prada spokesman Paolo Martinoni, the mast gave way because of a broken fitting on the starboard stay, the series of vertical cables that runs from the deck to the top of the mast. The Italians installed and tested a spare mast it late tonight in order to prepare for Thursday's race against Le Defi Francais. But with seven races remaining, they will have to regain momentum in a hurry.</p><p>On Monday, they were beaten by Stars and Stripes when ITA-45 suffered damage to its boom vang: an element that is nowhere near as essential as a mast. ''I think the new mast is close enough to the old one to do a good job,'' Prada's skipper, Francesco de Angelis, said.</p><p>For the moment, one can say that Stars and Stripes is the team with momentum. Dennis Conner's syndicate built its single boat very late in comparison with its competitors but it is now 3-0 after defeating Le Defi Francais today by the very convincing margin of 3 minutes 6 seconds.</p><p>Le Defi, now 0-3, was expected to give Stars and Stripes a stronger challenge in the lighter wind conditions prevailing today. Instead, the French entered the start zone before the five-minute countdown had begun, thereby incurring a penalty. After losing the start to Stars and Stripes, the French then incurred a second penalty after the boats collided near the end of the first leeward leg, which damaged the stern of the Conner boat.</p><p>America One is now 2-1, as is Nippon Challenge, which defeated the other San Franciso based challenger, America True, by 1:31 despite a rare loss at the start. America True is 1-2, its victory coming Monday when America One broke its jib halyard with a big lead.</p><p>But America One was considerably luckier today, particularly at the start, where a bold jibe through a desperately tight space between the race committee boat and the Italian Luna Rossa gave it a 10-second lead at the start over Prada: a lead that, as it turned out, Cayard's boat would not need to get a valuable point.</p><p>''It was pretty shocking for sure,'' Cayard said. ''Breaking the mast is pretty severe compared to what we broke the other day. But effectively, it still cost us both one point. I guess we feel a little less guilty about winning the race like this because of what happened to us the other day.''</p></body></html>
