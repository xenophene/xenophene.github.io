<p><strong></strong>Among those who were surprised by Bill Belichick's decision to resign as coach of the Jets was his father, Steve Belichick, a former assistant football coach at Navy for 33 years.</p><p>''I was just watching it on television and wondering what's going on,'' the senior Belichick said yesterday. ''We were up there for Christmas and I last talked to him a week ago. My wife talked to him briefly yesterday. He told her Bill Parcells had resigned and he was the Jets' new coach. He told her, 'I'll talk to you later,' but later never came. She never got the idea that things were unsettled.</p><p>''When he said on TV that he had resigned, he said there was an unsettled situation for him and his family. Bill has always been concerned about his family. That's been a determining factor about taking a job. He could have taken jobs in the past in some cities, but he didn't like the school systems there. His wife was a schoolteacher, and whenever he was asked about taking a job, she checked the school system.</p><p>''He has great concern as a father. He realizes he doesn't spend as much time with his kids as the average father, but when he has the time that's where he spends it.</p><p>''This whole thing surprises me. He wanted another shot at a head job, but he wasn't going to compromise on some things. There are other jobs. But he loves New York, and when he was with the Giants he loved it. When he was at New England he loved it. He's an East Coast guy. I don't have a clue what's going to happen next.''</p></body></html>
