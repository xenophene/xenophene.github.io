<p><strong></strong>Bill Belichick's resignation yesterday, a day after he was named head coach of the Jets, left pro football fans around town confused, shocked and dismayed. Some called Belichick's departure a betrayal of his mentor, Bill Parcells, and of the team and its fans.</p><p>Gregory Bezkorovainy, 34, of Brooklyn was at Johnny Mack's, a bar/restaurant in Park Slope.</p><p>''It seems like a knuckleheaded move,'' he said. ''It's got to affect the team. It's the understanding that he's been anointed, that he's the heir apparent to Parcells, so it's a real kick in the teeth. It's surprising because this is a team on its way up, barring anything catastrophic. They can't help but improve. If I were Parcells, I'd be upset. He was doing his buddy a favor. It's almost a betrayal.''</p><p>Mike Malone, a 40-year-old bar owner from Patchogue, N.Y., said he was so stunned by yesterday's developments ''that I drove in from Long Island instead of taking the train just so I could listen to the press conference on the radio.'' He said he was disappointed by what he heard.</p><p>''I got a call from my stockbroker,'' Malone said, ''and he wasn't calling to tell me how bad the market was doing. It was to tell me about Belichick. I was shocked. He has two big shoes to fill. I think he's going to sit out a year. I don't think he really explained the reason for his resignation.''</p><p>Malone's cousin, Bill Donnelly, a 42-year-old dress manufacturer from Old Westbury, N.Y., predicted that the loss of Belichick would hurt the Jets next season.</p><p>He, and many others, speculated that Belichick could not handle the pressures of New York and was interested in joining the New England Patriots, who want him as head coach. They seemed sure that the Patriots had offered all kinds of inducements, although the National Football League has ruled that no team except the Jets can talk to Belichick without permission from the Jets. Such permission has not been granted.</p><p>''He must have been contacted by New England,'' Donnelly said. ''It's going to be devastating to the Jets. It puts a big knot in what's going to happen with the team. We don't know about ownership, who is going to manage the team, and now this. The Jets definitely won't be as good as we thought.''</p><p>Pat Stebbins, 63, of Brooklyn said New York fans would be unmerciful if Belichick joined the Patriots.</p><p>''I'm totally mystified by this,'' he said. ''I don't know what's going on. He will be vilified by fans if he goes to the Patriots. Parcells left him a good legacy. The players are probably as confused and bewildered as everyone else. But on the other hand, Belichick didn't do that well as a coach in Cleveland, so maybe this is a blessing in disguise. Maybe the new owners are a factor. But he's been given a good franchise by Parcells and he thumbs his nose at it. Fans will have trouble forgiving.''</p><p>Michael Hillyer, 44, a bartender at Snookys in Brooklyn, said Belichick ''has done a good job for the Jets and doesn't owe the City of New York anything.'' However, Hillyer said, ''I would be upset if he went to the Patriots because then he would be lying to the people of New York.''</p><p>Others were supportive of Belichick's decision.</p><p>''No one likes to be second-guessed, and he would be second-guessed by Parcells and the press all the time,'' said James R. McGlynn, a 59-year-old retired Wall Streeter.</p><p>McGlynn was in Cannons Pub on the Upper West Side. On the next bar stool was John C. Downes, a 59-year-old electrician who said he had been a Jets fan since 1964, when the team was known as the Titans.</p><p>''It's the same as Vince Lombardi leaving the Giants to go to Green Bay, to get out from under the umbrella of Jim Lee Howell and go out on his own,'' Downes said. ''This is what Belichick has to do, to get away from his apron strings. If he wants to be a decent, respected coach, he has to make it on his own terms, create his own legacy.''</p><p>To Kevin Veal, a 25-year-old bartender at Johnny Mack's: ''The whole thing makes no sense to me. These are the kinds of things that always happen to the team. It's the curse of the Jets.''</p><p>Paul Tague, a 34-year-old electrician awaiting a train to Wantagh, N.Y., is a Giants fan. He enjoyed it all.</p><p>''I wanted to rub it in to the Jets fans at work,'' he said. ''I told them they're back to being the Mickey Mouse organization they were before Parcells. One guy quits, hires the other guy and then he quits. Come on, what's going on?''</p></body></html>
