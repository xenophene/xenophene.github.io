<p><strong></strong>Randy L. Levine is stepping down as deputy mayor and will receive an important-sounding title from the Yankees soon -- club president, perhaps. But he might as well be knighted and known as Sir Randy, for as Yankee employees have learned over the years, titles do not mean anything in the organization.</p><p>What matters is that Levine has influence with George Steinbrenner, the principal owner. So until that changes, Levine will play a major role in the organization. No one else in the organization knows exactly what Levine's responsibilities will entail, but Steinbrenner likes the 44-year-old lawyer, so Steinbrenner hired him.</p><p>''This is a classic George move,'' said one club official.</p><p>The announcement on Levine's hiring will come just in time for the forthcoming arbitration season. Today is the first day eligible players can apply for arbitration, a process that promises to be expensive for the Yankees this year.</p><p>Shortstop Derek Jeter and closer Mariano Rivera, probably the team's two best players, are eligible for arbitration, along with pitchers Ramiro Mendoza and Jason Grimsley and catcher Jorge Posada.</p><p>Last year, the Yankees had the only two arbitration losses suffered by teams, both with stunning results: Jeter won $5 million, a record for players with three years of service time, and Rivera was awarded $4.25 million. Following their arbitration victories, Jeter continued to establish himself as one of the game's best players -- with more career hits in his first four seasons (795) than Pete Rose, Ty Cobb or Henry Aaron -- and Rivera became the game's best reliever, going through the last three and one-half months of the season without allowing a run.</p><p>The arbitration decisions last year infuriated Steinbrenner, who essentially has blamed General Manager Brian Cashman. As a result, Levine will likely play a leading role in dealing with the arbitration cases.</p><p>The Yankees have had cursory discussions with Jeter, Rivera and the other eligible players about long-term deals. The Yankees may meet face to face in the next few days with Jeter's agent, Casey Close. Rivera has indicated he will do whatever it takes to stay with the Yankees, but signing Jeter to a long-term deal in the near future could be extremely difficult because the perspectives of the two sides on fair-market value could be radically different.</p><p>Sometime in the next year, either Ken Griffey Jr. or shortstop Alex Rodriguez, both eligible for free agency this fall, may become the first players to sign contracts for more than $125 million. If Jeter waits for free agency after the 2001 season, he might get as much or more. Steinbrenner, on the other hand, has been uniformly conservative in his long-term offers to arbitration-eligible players, and as long as he does not sign Jeter to a multiyear deal, Steinbrenner will maintain the flexibility of his own budget.</p><p>The relationship between Bernie Williams and the team was strained when the center fielder went through arbitration. Williams felt slighted as the Yankees' officials debated just how good Williams was, and how much he was worth. Williams almost left the team as a free agent before agreeing to a seven-year, $87.5 million deal in November 1998.</p><p>There does not seem to be any similar contentiousness developing between the Yankees and Jeter. No one has any doubt that Jeter is going to be a great player for a long time, and in turn Jeter appears to take the situation in stride, realizing that no matter what happens, he is going to make a lot of money.</p><p>''He's fine with it,'' Close said. ''He understands and he's well aware of the business side of the game, the economic side. He's not upset by it.''</p><p>The Mets also have a handful of arbitration cases, including pitchers Armando Benitez and Rick Reed and shortstop Rey Ordonez. Players and teams will exchange proposed salary figures Jan. 18, before a schedule of hearings will be set. Unless a settlement is reached before a hearing, an arbitrator will choose the salary proposed either by a team, or the player.</p><p>INSIDE PITCH</p><p>The Yankees will wait until spring training to complete the HIDEKI IRABU trade with the Montreal Expos, but an official in Major League Baseball said the Yankees are strongly considering taking JEREMY POWELL as one of the players to be named. Powell, 23, spent most of last season pitching in the majors, compiling a 4.73 earned run average in 97 innings for the Expos. Powell is 6 feet 6 inches and 225 pounds, and throws hard. Several scouts who have seen him pitch believe he is on the cusp of developing into a solid major league pitcher. The Yankees want to wait until the end of spring training to complete their selection of Powell -- they are considering another pitcher, as well -- to protect themselves against the possibility of injury and so they can do more extensive scouting. The Yankees, who also acquired the sinkerballer JAKE WESTBROOK in the deal, will be allowed to take a third player who is of lesser value than Westbrook or Powell.</p></body></html>
