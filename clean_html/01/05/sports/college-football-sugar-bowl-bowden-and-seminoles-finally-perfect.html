<p><strong></strong>It took 392 games, 34 years and many final-second heartbreaks. But finally, Bobby Bowden completed an undefeated season as top-ranked Florida State captured its second national title of the 1990's with a 46-29 victory tonight over previously undefeated and second-ranked Virginia Tech.</p><p>Bowden, sure enough, had his 70-year-old heart tested again -- largely by Michael Vick, Virginia Tech's 19-year-old freshman quarterback. When Vick waltzed through the Seminoles' defense like a ballroom dancer changing partners -- not once but twice in the waning moments of the third quarter -- it seemed as if Bowden's dream of a perfect season may have had to wait till next season.</p><p>''There was a moment of the truth in the late third quarter where they had the momentum and was fixin' to win the ballgame and our kids came back,'' Bowden said.</p><p>Peter Warrick, Florida State's spectacular senior receiver, was selected the game's most valuable player after finishing with six receptions for 163 yards and 2 touchdowns, and a punt return for another score. Quarterback Chris Weinke completed 20 of 34 passes for 329 yards and 4 touchdowns in lifting the Seminoles to a 12-0 record.</p><p>Vick accounted for 342 yards of Virginia Tech's offense: 23 rushes for 97 yards and a touchdown, and 15-for-29 passing for 245 yards and another touchdown.</p><p>Vick was on the verge of wiping out a 14-point halftime deficit by igniting a 15-point rally. His 15-yard scramble was elegant, his 22-yard streak ethereal. When Andre Kendrick bulled the final 6 yards after the second of the dashes to put Virginia Tech (11-1) ahead, 29-28, late in the third quarter, even the most hard- and Hokie-hearted in the crowd of 79,280 had to feel for the old man on the sideline -- except for another old man, Weinke.</p><p>Weinke, a 27-year-old former minor league baseball player, proved that he wanted the national title as much as Bowden did. Three more times, he marched the Seminoles down the field -- first a methodical, 11-play drive that was capped by a 14-yard touchdown pass to Ron Dugans -- the receiver's second and Weinke's third of the night.</p><p>Then, when Vick fumbled the ball away at the Hokies' 34 after a 12-yard gain, Weinke got the Seminoles close enough for a 32-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski. Suddenly, the Seminoles were back ahead, 39-29, and a perfect season once more appeared in sight. In fact, it was assured when, on the next possession, Weinke lasered a 33-yard touchdown strike to Warrick.</p><p>The Seminoles' victory came in a milestone season for Bowden, one that included a historic father-son matchup against the Clemson Tigers coached by his son Tommy.</p><p>It was the 32nd meeting between the top two teams in the Associated Press's Top 25. But it was only the 13th time that the meeting had occurred in a bowl game. With Florida State's victory, the top-ranked team improved to 19-11-2.</p><p>''They made some great plays,'' Virginia Tech Coach Frank Beamer said. ''We did some things that were uncharacteristic of our team in the kicking game and letting long plays in the first half.''</p><p>Before this No. 1-vs.-No. 2 matchup in front of the largest crowd to see a Sugar Bowl at the Superdome, both coaches had said that special players and special teams would break open the game. In taking a 28-14 halftime lead, Florida State seemed to have the better of both. In a seven-minute span, the Seminoles scored 14 points off special teams. Throughout the first half, Warrick was more spectacular than Vick.</p><p>Warrick, who scored the game's first touchdown on a 64-yard reception, ripped a punt return 59 yards for another score.</p><p>Vick, meanwhile, was valiant and dazzling, but he did not have enough help from his teammates as he scrambled for 71 first-half yards and a touchdown in the final seconds of the half. He tossed for another 93 yards and a score.</p><p>Both Bowden and Beamer believed special teams might be the difference in the game. But neither could have anticipated how swiftly those units would shape the game.</p><p>With 2:14 left in the first quarter and Florida State holding a 7-0 lead, the Seminoles blocked Jimmy Kibble's punt from the Virginia Tech end zone, and Jeff Chaney returned the ball 6 yards for the touchdown.</p><p>Virginia Tech, which wasted little time unleashing the array of offensive weapons it employed to go undefeated and get to this national-title game, needed a quick response.</p><p>The Hokies had wasted an impressive 77-yard drive to open the game when, on fourth-and-1 at the Florida State 3-yard line, Beamer decided to go for the first down rather than attempt the field goal. Instead of powering over the center, Vick tried the option to the right side, but linebacker Derrick Gibson stripped him of the ball, which squirted into the end zone. Seminoles nose guard Corey Simon smothered it for a touchback.</p><p>Now, trailing by 14-0, the Hokies needed points; Vick took just 1:44 to get them. With three plays, the Hokies went 80 yards, the final 49 of them on a rainbow to Andre Davis.</p><p>It took the Florida State offense a while to rev up. But Weinke did so emphatically. He answered Vick's strike with a rapid flick of his own, this time for 63 yards and a touchdown to Dugans.</p><p>Then, Warrick again reminded the Heisman Trophy voters who did not put him on their ballot after his arrest and guilty plea in a shopping scam that one bad decision doesn't short-circuit electrifying talent.</p><p>When Kibble sliced a short punt off his left foot, Warrick gathered the ball in on the Florida State 41-yard line and, with a burst, zigzagged down the hashmarks between Hokies all the way to the end zone.</p><p>''I give this whole victory to Coach Bowden,'' Warrick said. ''He's been like my father away from home. We came together as a team for him.''</p></body></html>
