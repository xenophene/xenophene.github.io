<p><strong></strong>EVER since that fateful afternoon last September when he soiled a stellar reputation, Peter Warrick has tried to live down the humiliation of a felony count of grand theft that was reduced to a misdemeanor count. Warrick became the latest poster boy for the evils of big-time college sports and triggered debates that were so intense that the deeds that elevated him to prominence were obliterated.</p><p>Warrick was rightly punished by the law but wrongly ostracized by Heisman Trophy voters, who used their ballots to punish Warrick, clearly one of the top three players in the nation. He was then shunned by the Biletnikoff award voters despite being the country's best wide receiver by a landslide. Warrick was stripped before he was honored.</p><p>Last night, in the frenzied atmosphere of the Superdome, Warrick finally let his feet and hands do the talking.</p><p>In the first half Warrick accounted for 159 yards of offense and 2 touchdowns. He sliced up the Hokie secondary with three catches and created holes even when he was the decoy. Just as Virginia Tech was settling into an emotional groove in the first quarter, Warrick burst the Hokies' bubble on a 64-yard touchdown pass from Chris Weinke, the 27-year-old quarterback, to give Florida State a 7-0 lead.</p><p>The dramatic touchdown confirmed the Hokies' worst fears: they had no answer for the Heisman candidate that never was. When Warrick walked out to take a second-quarter punt, you almost knew he was going to explode. He took the punt on a hop, raced down the right sideline past everything and everyone for a 59-yard touchdown and a 28-7 Seminole lead. Warrick would go on to score 20 points for the game.</p><p>''I bounced back; that's the mark of a man -- to admit to a mistake and move on,'' he said. ''I made a mistake, and I'll tell this: I'll never make it again. I'm ready to focus on the next level.''</p><p>The only thing that kept Virginia Tech close was the fact that the Hokies had a super player of their own, Michael Vick, the freshman quarterback. From the third play of the opening drive when Vick ran for 25 yards on 2nd-and-16, Florida State realized that Tech had a weapon nearly as potent as its own. Vick accounted for both of Tech's touchdowns -- a 49-yard pass to Andre Davis in the first quarter and a three-yard run in the second.</p><p>In an odd way the controversy surrounding Warrick -- his crime, the punishment and the fact that he graduated -- contributed to make the national championship a great college football game. Warrick's poor judgment got him into a national mess, and his poor judgment last night nearly cost his team the title.</p><p>With Florida State leading, 28-23, in the third quarter, Warrick picked up a personal foul when he shot an unnecessary forearm at Ronyell Whitaker, the Hokies' defensive back, at the end of the play. Why? He made the catch, tried to maneuver past Whitaker, but couldn't get by -- end of story. Instead, Warrick gave way to ego and was penalized. On the next play, Weinke was intercepted trying to go long to Warrick.</p><p>Meanwhile, the 19-year-old Vick was making all of the right moves and all of the great decisions. After the interception, Vick gained 15 yards on one play, was sacked and then came back with a 22-yard run that set up Virginia Tech's go-ahead touchdown in the third quarter. But Warrick atoned. After his team scored, Warrick caught the 2-point conversion, and Florida State led, 36-29. Moments later, Vick made his only mistake of the game. He fumbled after a 12-yard gain with 11 minutes 58 seconds to play. By the end of the game, fans were chanting, ''Peter Warrick.'' With 7:42 remaining, Warrick scored on a 43-yard touchdown pass to seal Coach Bobby Bowden's first undefeated season.</p><p>Bowden dismissed the notion that contemporary athletes were doing more bad things.</p><p>''It's not bad guys who are bad all the time,'' he said. ''It's your good guys who come from great families. They go out and do something wrong. The truth is the kids haven't changed. The difference is that everybody knows about it now.''</p><p>The coach's solution: ''If you don't want everybody to know about it, don't be No. 1, be No. 50.''</p><p>The arc of change has been dramatic for Bowden, who was born in Birmingham, Ala., in 1929. He told of an incident one spring in the late 1940's when he and friends sneaked onto a local golf course early in the morning. ''One day there was a young black kid on the course -- he was a caddie. We invited him to play. I looked up the fairway and here comes this truck bearing down on us. I thought, 'Uh-oh, we've been caught, playing golf not paying money. This guy jumps out with a .38, goes over to the black kid and puts the gun to his forehead. 'What are you doing playing golf out here?' They berated him, then they put him in the car; that's the last I saw of him. That's the first time I really understood what this segregation was about.''</p><p>Time heals all wounds; time allows meaning to unfold. And if you recruit well, and you're lucky, time might even bring forth a national championship or two.</p></body></html>
