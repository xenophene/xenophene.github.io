<p><strong></strong>Back in the early 1990's when the Cowboys were rolling, the playoffs were a forgone conclusion and anything less than a Super Bowl victory was considered abject failure, Dallas running back Emmitt Smith was at the forefront of a powerful offensive attack. He gobbled up yards behind the Cowboys battering ram of an offensive line.</p><p>Along the way, the Cowboys got away from that power running game. Coach Chan Gailey took it out of his offensive strategy. They tinkered with traps and sweeps. Finesse blocking seeped into the offensive scheme. Injuries began to nag at Smith and the whispers that follow all great veteran running backs started swirling around Smith. Was he washed up? Had he lost a step?</p><p>But this past Sunday against the Giants, the Cowboys went back to their bread and butter -- straight ahead, brute power, helmet-on-helmet blocking. And with Smith running primarily between the tackles, the 10-year Cowboy picked up 122 yards rushing, including a 45-yard run that helped set up the first Dallas touchdown of the game.</p><p>Smith's performance helped propel the Cowboys into the playoffs as a wild-card entry and the fifth-seeded team in the National Football Conference. Dallas will face Minnesota in the wild-card game on Sunday. It is an uphill fight for the Cowboys, who were 1-7 on the road during the season and are trying to become the first 8-8 team to win a Super Bowl. If they have any hope of beating the Vikings at Minnesota and advancing to the divisional round of the playoffs, the Cowboys will need another dominating performance from their offensive line and Smith.</p><p>''We have to run the football,'' Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders said. ''We want to run the football to keep that offense off the field. The more we keep that offense off the field, the less we see of them. We want to do that.''</p><p>Though the Cowboys lost to the Vikings, 27-17, when they played in Minneapolis on Nov. 8, Dallas has confidence that it can beat the Vikings at the Metrodome. Part of that confidence is because Smith has always fared well against Minnesota. Entering this season, Smith's 5.2 yards a carry average against the Vikings was the best he has had against any nondivision opponent. In three games he has rushed for 298 yards and 6 touchdowns.</p><p>In the game against the Vikings earlier this season Smith rushed for 140 yards and two touchdowns on 13 carries (10.8 yards a carry) in only one half of play. It was actually 24 minutes of play. Smith broke his hand on a 63-yard touchdown run, but came back for one more play -- a 24-yard touchdown run -- before leaving the game in the second quarter. The 18-second span between touchdown runs was the fastest that anyone has scored touchdowns in league history.</p><p>''That was a great night of a half of football,'' Smith said. ''I never got a chance to see the other half. That's behind us. I'm not going to worry about that, because I know that might not ever come again. Opportunities like that come around every so often, but we look forward to having those opportunities again. At least we're confident that we can do it. If you did it one time you believe you can do it again.''</p><p>Smith added: ''I know this time that it's going to be a little different. They're going to go back and study the tape and see exactly what they did wrong. They played hard. It's not going to be a cakewalk.''</p><p>Smith finished this season with 1,275 yards rushing, which was third-best in the N.F.C. behind Washington running back Stephen Davis, who had 1,405 and Marshall Faulk of St. Louis, who had 1,302. Sunday marked Smith's ninth 100-yard rushing game of the season, which capped his ninth straight season of 1,000 yards or more rushing. The 122-yard performance against the Giants was a flash from the 1995 season, which pushed the Cowboys to their last Super Bowl championship. Smith's rushing totals this season were the best he has had since 1995, when he rushed for 1,773 yards.</p><p>A string of injuries cut into Smith's productivity after the 1995 season, but nothing hurt him more than bone spurs in his ankles. The painful ailment reduced his ability to make cuts and make defensive players miss. Following the 1997 season, Smith had surgery to have the bone spurs removed. His cutting ability is back.</p><p>Though he broke his hand against Minnesota, missed the game against Green Bay the following week and came out early against Philadelphia after pulling a groin muscle, Smith said the past two seasons have been the most healthy he has had in five years. He said he does not listen to the talk that he has lost steam. In a way, his position mirrors that of the Cowboys.</p><p>''People counted me out, quite naturally because we were losing,'' he said. ''But when you're winning things change. It helped. I'm fortunate that we won eight games and we're going to the playoffs. We haven't won a lot of games, but we won eight and we're in the playoffs. Our record is not the best, but we're in the playoffs.''</p></body></html>
