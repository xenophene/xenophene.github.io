<p><strong></strong>It is usually a dream destination for avid cross-country skiers. In this shockingly mild winter, however, a long-awaited New Year's vacation at the Lapland Lake Cross-Country Ski and Vacation Center revealed more brown ground than winter wonderland. Surprisingly, however, the visit also turned into more of a jolly sleepwalk than a snowless nightmare.</p><p>In the best of times, Lapland Lake presents skiers with 50 kilometers (31 miles) of trails that wind through the pine forests in the south-central part of the Adirondack Forest Preserve, 60 miles from Albany and about a four-hour drive from the New York metropolitan area. The trail system, designed by the former United States Olympic cross-country skier, Olavi Hirvonen, has 38 kilometers (23.6 miles) that are meticulously groomed (for both classical and skating styles) using three state-of-the-art tracking Snowcats. The degree of difficulty ranges from easy to expert-only trails. There is also a 12-kilometer (7.2 mile) snowshoe trail that surrounds and bisects the one-way skiing trails. Four kilometers (2.4 miles) of trails are lighted for night skiing.</p><p>In the past 10 years, Lapland Lake has had only one season (1994-95) of fewer than 100 inches of snowfall; that season, it got 94. Founded by Hirvonen in 1978, the resort has clocked more than 100 days of skiing in each year it has operated, opening for business as early as Nov. 15 in 1997-98 and closing as late as April 18 in 1992-93. But that's in the best of times. Not this winter. So far, there has been a paltry six inches of snow, and that was in mid-December. What was left over was bald and icy. Skiing along the Woods Lake trail (the only time on skis all weekend) was like kissing a tigress -- very dangerous and no pleasure at all.</p><p>''I don't think that we've ever had a winter like this,'' said Hirvonen, a robust 69-year-old monument to a healthy, active Nordic lifestyle. ''Normally on the weekend, we get anywhere between 350 and 600 day skiers.'' Race days and the annual Ski Fest can attract more than 1,000 skiers. This holiday weekend, he had about 100.</p><p>To be sure, Lapland Lakes' 10 trailside tupas (Finnish for housekeeping cottages) were all occupied, most by a passel of returnees who opted for a quiet New Year's weekend. The cosy cottages have two to four bedrooms that can accommodate up to 10 people (bring your own towels and linens), a fully appointed kitchen (pack your own food) and wood-burning stove (logs provided). No TV. No phone. No smoking.</p><p>As for the skiing, keep dreaming. ''We didn't know if people were still going to come,'' Ann Hirvonen, Olavi's wife, said. ''But even without snow they decided to come. It's unbelievable.''</p><p>While the disappointment over the lack of snow was palpable, Lapland Lake proved that it could keep even the most obstreperous children (and adults) occupied.</p><p>The nominally snow-covered tubing hill was an instant attraction for the children as was the adjacent pond and the Napa Kiikku (arctic sled ride) contraption. Picture a kind of Nordic centrifuge, with a wooden sled connected to a long wood arm, which is fastened to a tree trunk sunk into the ice. With a rider kneeling and hanging on tight, the sled slides around the ice with increasing centrifugal force as people push the wood arm.</p><p>The frozen, 70-acre Woods Lake was the other primary diversion. On the lake, Hirvonen organized a wacky Finnish game of Kyykka -- think of it as bowling on ice with oversized wood bats substituting for bowling balls. Kick-sled racing followed as folks began to scatter -- some skiing around the lake on its meager snow cover, while others laced up their ice skates and headed for the lake's center and an expanse of smooth ice.</p><p>So while there was not paljon lunta (lots of snow) at Lapland Lake, it was the right place for cross-country skiers, but at the wrong time.</p><p>You can check the Lapland Lake Web site (www.laplandlake.com) for conditions or call (800) 453-SNOW for a 24-hour taped report.
