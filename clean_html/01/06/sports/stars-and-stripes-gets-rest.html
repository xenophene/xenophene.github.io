<p><strong></strong>As it turned out, Stars and Stripes did not miss any action at all today in the America's Cup challenger semifinals. The challenger was given permission to postpone its scheduled race with America True and repair the damage suffered to its stern in a collision on Wednesday. But because of a lack of wind on the Hauraki Gulf, there was no racing.</p><p>The question now is whether Stars and Stripes, which surprisingly leads this semifinal round with a 3-0 record, will be ready to race on Friday. It suffered the damage to its boat near the end of the first leeward leg against Le Defi Francais, when the French boat's bow cut into its stern. The French were penalized for altering course, and the Americans were left with a three-foot crack in their scoop.</p><p>''We'll take a win anyway we can get it right now, but we feel we have some momentum, so this is frustrating,'' said Ken Read, the Stars and Stripes helmsman.</p></body></html>
