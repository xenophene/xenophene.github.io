<p><strong></strong>It was difficult to know what to make of the Syracuse men's basketball team so far this season. The Orangemen were 9-0 and ranked seventh in the nation -- a highly touted and deeply experienced team -- entering tonight's Big East Conference opener against Rutgers, but for several weeks they were followed by snickers about their absurd schedule.</p><p>Most teams play creampuffs early in the season in an attempt to assess their weaknesses and build confidence. But no other team in the nation had had the luxury of never boarding so much as a skateboard for a game.</p><p>Connecticut had played Duke and Iowa in Madison Square Garden, not that it helped the Huskies in their Big East opener, which they lost at home tonight to Notre Dame. Other teams had gone away to holiday tournaments. The Orangemen, who beat Rutgers by 93-74 tonight, had blown out Princeton, Florida Atlantic and Albany in the Carrier Dome. In fact, they had blown out every opponent in the Carrier Dome, redefining the home-court advantage.</p><p>Reporters have pecked away at Coach Jim Boeheim about this schedule like woodpeckers on a tree. His response varied: sometimes he pointed out the relative merits of Wisconsin and Richmond, whom the Orangemen also beat, and said he had tried to schedule tougher teams but couldn't do it.</p><p>Other times he recalled Syracuse's dreadful home record last season (3-6 in the league) and said he hoped to bolster his team by constructing the schedule this way.</p><p>But still, the questions lingered as Syracuse headed into the teeth of the season. Were the Orangemen, returning all five starters from a team that won 21 games and handed the Huskies one of their two losses last season, serious contenders to challenge Connecticut's dominance of the league this season, picked as they were to finish second in the Big East and advance deep into the postseason? Or were the perfect record and lofty spot in the poll merely a luminescent bubble that would burst once the Richmonds and La Salles were out of the way and the Orangemen had to leave the Carrier Dome in the rearview mirror?</p><p>Tonight the Orangemen clung to their legitimacy and their perfect record, but the queries will surely linger a bit longer, as they battled for most of the game against a young Rutgers team before pulling away for their 10th victory of the season.</p><p>Only in the final minutes of tonight's game were the Orangemen able to string together a sustained run to give themselves more than a single-digit lead.</p><p>Their senior point guard and leader, Jason Hart, who entered the game leading Big East players in assists with 7.1 a game, did not rattle his freshman counterpart, Todd Billet, who had been flummoxed by Hofstra. The Orangemen were unable to exploit their significant size advantage, failing to pound the ball inside against Rutgers's little-used zone defense, instead relying on a series of 3-pointers to cling to a 42-37 lead at halftime.</p><p>But when center Etan Thomas, miserable in the first half with no points and no rebounds, blocked a Rutgers shot with 6 minutes 36 seconds remaining, and then sprinted down the court for the dunk that followed, the lead was 11 points and Syracuse was on its way to a 19-9 run to conclude a victory that only at the end was as overwhelming as the margin indicated.</p><p>''The questions won't go away because we still haven't played on the road,'' Boeheim said. ''At this point in time, you usually have one or two tough road games. This whole team is back. We played 16 games on the road last year. It was never that much of a concern being on the road. We have not lost those games. At home, we lost games like this.''</p><p>Syracuse finally leaves home Saturday, for a game at Miami. The Orangemen will play three more nonconference games -- against South Carolina, U.C.L.A. and Louisville.</p><p>Tonight Boeheim was dissatisfied with the defense, which allowed Rutgers to shoot 50 percent in the first half and 4 of 8 from 3-point range. But Syracuse had 31 assists on 37 field goals and shot 63.9 percent in the second half as Rutgers wearied. The schedule will soon force Syracuse to show that kind of mettle on a regular basis. ''Every time you go out to play in this league, you get tested,'' Boeheim said.</p><p>For 30 minutes tonight, Rutgers gave the Orangemen some much-needed practice.</p></body></html>
