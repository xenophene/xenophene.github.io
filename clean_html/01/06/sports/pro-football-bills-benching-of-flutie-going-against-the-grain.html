<p><strong></strong>Conventional National Football League wisdom says that coaches don't bench starting quarterbacks who have guided their teams to 10 victories and brought them into the playoffs.</p><p>The Buffalo Bills' coach, Wade Phillips, didn't listen to conventional N.F.L. wisdom this week. He sent Doug Flutie to the bench for the season finale against the Colts last weekend in favor of Rob Johnson. And after Johnson completed 24 of 37 passes for 287 yards and 2 touchdowns in the Bills' 31-6 victory over Indianapolis, Phillips told Flutie he could keep his seat on the sideline. Johnson is going to be the Bills' playoff quarterback, a stunning decision and a risky move.</p><p>Buffalo's playoff road to the Super Bowl will begin in Tennessee against the 13-3 Titans this Saturday afternoon, then go through Jacksonville and end up at Indianapolis if the Bills keep winning,</p><p>''I don't think it's that difficult,'' said Titans Coach Jeff Fisher, regarding Phillips's decision to start Johnson. ''He's making an objective decision based on the information.''</p><p>Phillips has become defensive about his decision to bench Flutie in favor of Johnson. Today he refused to go into his thought process about the change other than to say that he made it after consulting members of his offensive staff.</p><p>Earlier in the week, Phillips was a little more expansive on his reasoning. ''To me, it goes back to last year when Rob was banged up,'' Phillips said on Monday after making the announcement. ''When Doug came in and played outstanding you couldn't ignore that, so I made that decision because I thought it was best for the team. This is the same decision. Doug played well for us and had a lot to do with those wins, and then Rob showed, in my opinion, that he can do things that it takes to win for us also. This time I said this guy really has a chance to help us.''</p><p>Today was Flutie's first day of practice after having been demoted to No. 2, and he took it hard.</p><p>''I thought I had gotten over it a little bit,'' Flutie said. ''Went back to work watching film, getting ready, going through game plans and meetings, talking things through. Step out on the field and see the other guy stepping into the huddle is hard. That bothered me. It's just something I have to deal with. It's like going out, making all the money, buying the car and then turning the keys over.''</p><p>How does Flutie deal with it?</p><p>''You deal with it by keeping that glimmer of hope that your opportunity is coming and you have to prepare to be ready for that opportunity,'' Flutie said. ''The thing that frustrates me more than anything is I've been waiting 10 years for this opportunity. We've got a great football team. We've got the best defense in the league. We've got a chance. This is the reason I came back. All of a sudden you turn it over.''</p><p>Flutie admitted to having been paranoid about being taken out for the season finale both this season and last season. When he played in New England in 1988, Patriots Coach Raymond Berry replaced him with Tony Eason late in the year. The next year, Flutie started three games and then was out of the N.F.L. for eight years, until Buffalo signed him last season. ''Only in my situation has this happened,'' Flutie said. ''I don't know of any other instances where this has happened, other than my two situations.'' Does he feel betrayed? ''I just feel it reinforces some of my prior views of the way things are.''</p><p>Johnson and Flutie have never had a close relationship. They're not buddies off the field, and at work it's all business. Johnson corralled his competitive urges and didn't lobby for the starting job. He sat back silently and watched Flutie take over. But he has been preparing himself for the starting job each week. Although Flutie has pledged his support of Johnson, he hasn't gone out of his way to help him prepare for the Titans this week.</p><p>''The only thing he's said to me is this is why you don't let other guys play and show what they can do,'' Johnson said. ''It's not awkward. The same thing happened last year. I got hurt. He took my spot. This time it was just performance based.''</p><p>At the beginning of the season, Phillips thought Flutie gave the Bills the best chance to win, and he was right. Flutie guided the team to a 10-5 record, although there was a three-game stretch during the middle of the season when the 37-year-old quarterback slumped and the team struggled, losing back-to-back games against Oakland and Seattle and winning by 13-10 at Baltimore.</p><p>Johnson, who has started just eight games in his five years in the N.F.L., does not question the timing of his opportunity.</p><p>''Basically he told me with me the team has the best chance of winning,'' Johnson said. ''That's good enough for me.''</p><p>Johnson said he didn't think that his teammates really cared who the quarterback is. ''I think they want the guy that they can win with,'' he said.</p><p>Bruce Smith, the Bills' veteran defensive end, said the team has as much chance of winning with Johnson than with Flutie. But he added, ''After that game against the Colts, Rob's got some momentum heading into the playoffs.''</p><p>While Flutie's combined rushing and passing yardage ranks eighth in the N.F.L., the Bills are 17th in points scored and 22nd in passing with Flutie as the starter. Buffalo also lacked explosiveness in its passing game with Flutie as quarterback, although Fisher said he believed Flutie could throw the ball down the field effectively if given the chance.</p><p>When the Bills traded for Johnson last season, giving Jacksonville first- and fourth-round picks in the 1998 draft, they did so with the thought that Johnson, who has a five-year, $25 million contract, would be the quarterback of the future.</p><p>Johnson started the first five games of last season before going down against Indianapolis with injured ribs. In the game before that, he went out in the fourth quarter against the Rams with a concussion.</p><p>Flutie came on and created a phenomenon in Buffalo, endearing himself to the community and becoming a marketing icon with his Flutie Flakes cereal. Johnson played the last game of the season so Flutie could rest a sore leg before Buffalo's first-round playoff game against Miami, which the Dolphins won, 24-17.</p><p>Johnson then became a forgotten man and didn't even start training camp for the 1999 season as the No. 1 quarterback.</p></body></html>
