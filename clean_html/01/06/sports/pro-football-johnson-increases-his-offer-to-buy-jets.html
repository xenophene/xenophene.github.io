<p><strong></strong>Robert Wood Johnson IV, a finalist in the bidding to buy the Jets, revised his offer yesterday, pulling at least even with the offer from the other finalist, Charles F. Dolan, said two people involved with the sale process.</p><p>Johnson and Dolan have now made bids in the range of $615 million to $625 million, the people involved in the sale said.</p><p>The financial differences between them appear to be so small that choosing the winner could center on which bidder has a better chance of being approved by a three-quarters vote of National Football League owners.</p><p>It was not known if Dolan would counter Johnson, or how much longer Goldman Sachs, which is handling the sale for the estate of Leon Hess, will keep the process going.</p><p>But Johnson's increased offer, which came after he returned from a Hawaiian vacation, demonstrates that the sale of the team has not been detoured by the turmoil that began Monday when Bill Parcells retired as head coach. His designated successor, Bill Belichick, resigned the next day, citing uncertainties about the future owner.</p><p>A winning bid may be chosen early next week by Goldman Sachs and the Hess estate, a few weeks later than had been anticipated. The selection would then have to be voted on by the N.F.L.'s finance committee, possibly at a meeting set for next Tuesday, and then by the full ownership on Jan. 18.</p><p>The finance committee postponed a conference call scheduled for yesterday to discuss the Jets' sale because there was not enough information to assess.</p><p>Coincidentally, Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, who appears interested in hiring Belichick as the head coach and general manager, is chairman of the finance committee.</p><p>One reason that Belichick's surprise resignation did not delay the sale of the team, said the people involved with the process, is that his seemingly rash decision and rambling demeanor at his news conference on Tuesday suggested to the suitors that he might have been ill-suited to take over for Parcells. Belichick's departure also ensured that Parcells, the chief football operations officer, would not choose a new coach without consulting whoever wins the right to purchase the Jets.</p><p>Johnson would probably have an easier time gaining N.F.L. approval than Dolan. A wealthy investor, philanthropist and Republican fund-raiser, Johnson is little known to the N.F.L. owners, and has not lobbied for votes.</p><p>Johnson has no baggage, unlike Dolan, whose Cablevision holdings -- including cable TV systems, sports and entertainment networks, Madison Square Garden, the Knicks, the Rangers and the Liberty -- concern the league enough to require him to separate his corporate and personal assets. That would bar Garden executives from running the Jets or from mingling the Jets with the Knicks or Rangers.</p><p>The N.F.L. bars corporate ownership, although many owners use their corporate wealth to buy teams as personal investments.</p><p>Bob Tisch, the co-owner of the Giants, said of Dolan: ''He's a man of great integrity. Whatever he signs, he'll live up to.''</p><p>Tisch said he saw no problem in having Dave Checketts, the president of the Garden, run the Jets. ''If he wants to use his assets to improve his team,'' Tisch said of Dolan, ''I don't object to it.''</p><p>Another Dolan supporter, Art Modell, the owner of the Baltimore Ravens, said, ''I can't fathom what Cablevision, or a cable system, or the Garden, has to do with the Jets.''</p><p>In the only previous test of Dolan's appeal to owners -- his joint bid with his brother, Lawrence, to buy the expansion Cleveland Browns in 1998 -- he received seven votes to Al Lerner's 22. On a subsequent ballot, the pro-Dolan votes shifted to Lerner.</p></body></html>
