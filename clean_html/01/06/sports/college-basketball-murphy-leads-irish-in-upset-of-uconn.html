<p><strong></strong>Most of tonight's Big East opener between Notre Dame and Connecticut was a head-to-head battle between the leading scorers for both teams -- the 6-foot-10-inch Troy Murphy and the 5-10 Khalid El-Amin. The UConn guard won that battle, outscoring Murphy by 34 points to 33 points. But Notre Dame won the game, 75-70, stunning the defending, second-ranked national champions.</p><p>With five straight victories and nine over all coming into the game, Notre Dame posed a legitimate threat to second-ranked Connecticut, which had won 10 straight games since losing its opener to Iowa.</p><p>But those five Irish victories were over Virginia Military Institute, Rider, Elon, St. Peter's and LoyolaMarymount, and all at home. The Irish had lost four games since upsetting Ohio State, which reached the Final Four last April, in the season opener.</p><p>No matter. Tonight, before a capacity crowd of 16,294 at the Hartford Civic Center, Notre Dame's young team surpassed that victory over Ohio State, and the sophomore forward Murphy, with 16 rebounds to go with his 33 points, had a lot to do with it. The Irish (10-5) built a 30-28 halftime lead to as many as 10 points before withstanding a gritty last-ditch one-man comeback by El-Amin, who tallied the Huskies' last 8 points.</p><p>Murphy came in with a 24-point average, and El-Amin with a 17-point average. While Connecticut connected on only 38.7 percent of its shots, El-Amin had 34 points on 11 of 26 shooting which included 5 of 10 from 3-point range.</p><p>Murphy, from Morristown, N.J., was even more accurate, hitting on 11 of 18 field goal attempts and 10 of 12 free throws, three of which were Notre Dame's final points. He said he used the film from last year's one-sided loss to Connecticut, when he fouled out after 11 points and just 5 rebounds, as motivation.</p><p>''I had a bad taste in my mouth from last year's game,'' Murphy said. ''I must have watched that film 20 times in the off-season. I wanted to play well.''</p><p>Matt Doherty, the first year Notre Dame coach who played at Holy Trinity High School in Hicksville on Long Island, was elated in the flush of victory. ''It's a thrill to get a win versus one of the most talented teams, if not the most talented teams, in America,'' said Doherty, who played alongside Michael Jordan at North Carolina and spent seven years as an assistant at Kansas before being picked to succeed John MacLeod. ''We rebounded well, despite playing zone, and that was important because our biggest fear was UConn's offense on the boards.''</p><p>Doherty need not have worried as the Irish outrebounded UConn, 40-33, and Murphy thoroughly dominated the Huskies' three primary rebounders, center Jake Voskuhl, who could manage only two rebounds and no points, and Voskuhl's backup, Souleymane Wane, and forward Kevin Freeman, who pulled down three and eight rebounds, respectively.</p><p>Apart from El-Amin, who had scored 30 and 22 points in his two previous games against Notre Dame, Connecticut had difficulty penetrating the Irish zone.</p><p>''The zone was good to us,'' Doherty said. ''We went to man-to-man for one possession and El-Amin went through it like a hot knife through butter.''</p><p>After trailing by 2 points at halftime, Connecticut went ahead by 35-33 early in the second half when Freeman scored on a 3-point play that included a breakaway dunk. A 3-pointer by shooting guard Albert Mouring (14 points and 6 rebounds) widened that margin to 38-35. But then Notre Dame went on a 10-0 run which gave it a lead, at 45-38, that it would never relinquish. That lead twice went to 10 points, at 59-49 and 68-58, with slightly less than two minutes left.</p><p>But then a 4-point play by Mouring, who was fouled as a sank an off-balance 3-pointer from the left corner, cut Notre Dame's lead to 6 points at 68-62 with l:47 remaining. El-Amin trimmed it to 3 points when he drove the lane, scored with a left-handed layup and made the ensuing foul shot.</p><p>''We got a lot of confidence from the Ohio State win and came in here feeling we could win,'' said Murphy, who time and again scored on jump shots at crucial junctures, often over Voskuhl and Wane, both 6-11. ''We felt we had nothing to lose.''</p></body></html>
