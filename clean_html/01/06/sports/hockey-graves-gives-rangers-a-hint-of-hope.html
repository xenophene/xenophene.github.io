<p><strong></strong>An overtime goal by Adam Graves gave the Rangers a 3-2 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs last night at Madison Square Garden, ending the Rangers' seven-game streak without a victory, offering their jubilant fans hope for better things in the second half of the season and showing the world what hockey can be like when the coaches let players have fun.</p><p>This was an energetic and entertaining show, played at a crackling pace, with goaltenders sparkling at both ends. After defenseman Kevin Hatcher broke up a Toronto rush in the New York zone, Graves ended the game with 34 seconds remaining in the five-minute extra session when he took a pass from Theo Fleury and wristed a shot past goalie Curtis Joseph to beat the team with the best record in the Eastern Conference and the second-best record in the National Hockey League.</p><p>''Theo made a great pass and I tried to get it away as quick as I could and get it on the net,'' said Graves, who has 13 goals, most on the team. ''Fortunately, it found its way in.''</p><p>The Rangers, 1-4-3 in their last eight games and near the bottom of the league most of the season, squandered a two-goal lead, but recovered in one of their best performances in months. It was the 10th time in their last 14 games that the Rangers have gone into overtime. They out-hit the visitors and both teams skated well, showing how hockey in the new decade could improve over the sluggish, defensive-based brand that smothered the sport in the last half of the 1990's.</p><p>''Great thing to watch,'' Ranger goalie Mike Richter said, referring to the Toronto style, a refreshing approach that took the Leafs to the third round of the Stanley Cup playoffs last spring. ''You hope a lot of teams imitate that. You had two teams with a fair amount of skill and can skate. I like to win those games. The players like playing those games and the fans like watching them.''</p><p>Richter faced 28 shots, with his game-saving save coming with 13 seconds remaining in regulation on Sergei Berezin. Joseph faced 40 shots, 5 of them by Petr Nedved, who scored the first goal of the game and his first since Nov. 24.</p><p>Nedved skated on a line with Jan Hlavac and Radek Dvorak, both of whom are also from the Czech Republic. Their speed and puck-handling skills seemed to mesh, especially against a team like Toronto, which dresses 10 European skaters out of 18.</p><p>''Lots of games left, I can still turn it around,'' said Nedved, who now has eight goals. ''When I play well, I can really help this team.'' After he scored on a wrist shot at 2 minutes 19 seconds of the first period, he joked that he didn't know how to react.</p><p>''I didn't know what to do afterward,'' Nedved said. ''Celebrate? Or sit on the bench?''</p><p>The Rangers' second goal was scored by John MacLean, after Joseph mishandled the puck in front of his net, but the Leafs tied it with one in the second by Kevyn Adams and another in the third, by Mats Sundin, the big center and captain. Sundin entered the game with 32 points, most on the Leafs, equally divided between goals and assists.</p><p>For many of his shifts, Sundin was matched against Tim Taylor, the Rangers' checking center, and the defense pair of Kevin Hatcher and Rich Pilon, who work against the best opposing scorers. Sundin had no shots on goal in the first two periods, but he scored at 5:07 of the third to tie it at 2-2. During a three-on-two rush, he took a pass from Tie Domi and ripped the puck past Richter.</p><p>It was the first game of a home-and-home series between two teams that have been rivals since the era of the six-team league. They meet again on Saturday night in Toronto. The Maple Leafs franchise has been rebuilt under the administration of Ken Dryden, the team president. Pat Quinn, the Toronto coach and general manager, seemed disgruntled about the play of his team, which had won seven of its previous eight games but has not won in the Garden since 1990. But John Muckler, the Ranger coach, was delighted.</p><p>''That's the way the game should be played,'' Muckler said. ''End-to-end rushes. Skill level was good on both sides. Sensational saves at both ends. It's a shame it can't be played that way every night.''</p><p>SLAP SHOTS</p><p>BRIAN LEETCH, the Ranger defenseman and captain, had the cast removed from his right forearm yesterday and replaced with a splint. Leetch, who has been skating, hopes to resume shooting the puck next week and could return in two weeks. He suffered a broken bone in the arm on Nov. 24 when blocking a shot. . . . Defenseman STEPHANE QUINTAL, who has neck spasms, missed his first game of the season. Playing in his place was JASON DOIG, who had not played since Nov. 26.</p></body></html>
