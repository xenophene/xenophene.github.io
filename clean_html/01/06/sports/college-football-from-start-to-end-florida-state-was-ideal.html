<p><strong></strong>The last college football season of the 20th century followed a compelling script right down to its potent final act: a national title matchup that should bury any notion that the game needs a playoff system.</p><p>Two undefeated teams -- one a perennial power, the other an upstart from the hills -- were left to play in the Sugar Bowl.</p><p>When the hitting was done Tuesday night, the power, Florida State, had withstood the upstart, Virginia Tech, 46-29, in a game that straddled the past and the future of the college game.</p><p>For those who remember Knute and Bear, there was an old coach, the 70-year-old Bobby Bowden, completing his first undefeated season with the obligatory shoulder ride from members of a 12-0 team that had done what no other had done before it. The team finished the season where it had started it: ranked No. 1 in both the coaches' and news media polls.</p><p>For those trying to predict what the Four Horsemen and the Galloping Ghosts of the next 100 years might look like, there was Virginia Tech's 19-year-old quarterback, Michael Vick. A mere freshman, he already appears blessed with computer-enhanced running and passing skills overwhelmingly perfect for this high-speed digital age.</p><p>More time-tested melodramas also played out on the artificial turf in the Sugar Bowl title game. Florida State's Peter Warrick acted out a redemptive story line and encapsulated his difficult year on the game's final score.</p><p>With Florida State leading, 39-29, Warrick went into the huddle and asked, ''Y'all want me to finish them?''</p><p>He did just that by running under a 43-yard pass, juggling it as the Hokies' Malcolm Tatum interfered with him, but still managed to hold on for his second touchdown catch of the game to go with a 59-yard touchdown on a punt return. Moments later, Warrick's brashness dissolved when he knelt on the Florida State sideline and cried.</p><p>Last year in the title game at the Fiesta Bowl, Warrick caught only one pass as the Seminoles lost to Tennessee. Then, when he decided to pass up the big money of the National Football League and return for his senior year, Warrick was hailed as representing everything that was right about college football. But by midseason, he became an icon for what was wrong with college football when he was arrested for a department store scam in which he and a teammate paid $21.40 for more than $412.38 of designer clothes.</p><p>Warrick served a two-game suspension, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and watched the Heisman Trophy and most other high-profile post-season awards slip through his fingers. All year he reminded himself of why he had returned to school: to graduate and win a national championship.</p><p>On Dec. 18, he earned a degree in political science. Tuesday night, he was named most valuable player of the Sugar Bowl and his team was crowned the national champion.</p><p>''This is the way it was supposed to end,'' Warrick said.</p><p>In the other locker room, the Hokies did what losers in big games usually do, what Florida State did last year: they wept.</p><p>''We had a pretty good cry in there a few minutes ago,'' Virginia Tech Coach Frank Beamer said.</p><p>By turning a 28-7 deficit into a 29-28 lead late in the third quarter, the Hokies may have reduced critics of the Bowl Championship Series to tears. As Virginia Tech earned its way here by winning week after week, the chorus for a college playoff once more got louder.</p><p>The complaints? The Hokies played a weak schedule. They were from a second-tier conference, the Big East. The B.C.S. formula, which calculates the polls, computer rankings and strength of schedule, was too complicated. But behind Vick, who threw for 225 yards and ran for another 97, Virginia Tech showed why it belonged in the title game.</p><p>The Hokies were talented. They were tenacious. They lined up without their second-leading receiver, Ricky Hall, who dislocated his wrist last week. They lost their 1,000-yard rusher, Shyrone Stith, after 68 first-half yards, to an ankle sprain. His replacement, Andre Kendrick, rumbled for another 69 yards. They pushed Florida State hard.</p><p>For the second year in a row, the B.C.S. attained its goal of matching the two best teams in the nation, because it understands that in a short, intense season, every Saturday is a playoff game. Both the oldest and the youngest players on the field understood this, as well as they understood that Virginia Tech is a budding power on a rapidly shifting college landscape.</p><p>''They'll be back in this game again,'' said Bowden, who knows something about building programs after 13 straight years of 10 or more victories in a season and two national titles.</p><p>Vick agreed. ''It was a great season,'' he said. ''If I could go back I wouldn't change nothing. When we came back you saw the heart of our team and how much we wanted to win. We'll get here again.''</p><p>It is a good bet that future title games will have even more fresh faces. Along with the usual suspects, Nebraska (No. 2 in the New York Times computer ranking, No. 3 in the A.P. poll) and Michigan (No. 3 in The Times's ranking and No. 5 A.P.), other upstarts cracked the top 10: Wisconsin (No. 8 in The Times and No. 4 A.P.), Kansas State (No. 7 in The Times, No. 6 A.P.) and the only other undefeated team in the nation, Marshall, finished No. 10 in both polls.</p><p>Bowden understands better than most how hard it is to be perfect. In his 34 years, he has coached 10 teams that have finished the season with one loss.</p><p>For the 24 years he has coached at Florida State, Bowden has kept an empty picture frame on his desk waiting for a photograph of his first undefeated team. Now he has it.</p><p>''It's a milestone,'' Bowden said. ''I could've gone the rest of my life and not had it happen.''</p></body></html>
