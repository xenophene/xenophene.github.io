<p><strong></strong>The lights were still dimmed at Nassau Coliseum this morning when Roberto Luongo skated onto the ice, a little more than 12 hours after the final goal had whizzed past his glove in the Islanders' 7-3 loss to Boston.</p><p>There was no practice scheduled, but the Islander captain Kenny Jonsson, who has a flu-like virus, and Gino Odjick, going through an eight-game suspension, wanted to have a two-pass game with the coaches Lorne Henning and Greg Cronin to keep in shape.</p><p>''I stopped by his locker and asked if he wanted to play,'' Jonsson said. ''His eyes just lit up. He wanted to get back out there.''</p><p>Luongo, the highest-drafted goalie in National Hockey League history (No. 4 over all in the 1997 draft), had just endured two of the worst games of his brief career, giving up nine goals against Pittsburgh and then seven against Boston, a team he had shut down in their two previous meetings including his N.H.L debut on Nov. 28.</p><p>''I wanted to empty out the bad vibes from last night,'' the 20-year-old Luongo said after a half-hour on the ice. ''I hate having bad games. I really can't stand myself. It's brutal.''</p><p>Luongo's game at the Igloo was not especially bad, considering the state of the Islanders defense and that five of the goals came on power plays. But his performance Tuesday evening was another matter. It started at 13 minutes 55 seconds of the first period, when Luongo flat-out missed a long wrist shot from Joe Murphy and did not end until Anson Carter scored his second goal with 2:11 left to play.</p><p>''That first goal was like, 'Wow -- how did that one go in?' '' Luongo said. ''What was I doing? What was I thinking?''</p><p>In another situation, a rookie giving up 16 goals in two games would not be cause for alarm -- simply send him back to the minors for a while. But the 9-23-5 Islanders are trying to balance developing their prize prospect with winning a couple of games.</p><p>''These are the situations we were afraid of,'' Islanders Coach Butch Goring said. ''The expectations for him are so high, but he's a very young kid playing with a young hockey team. We don't have the kind of hockey team to be able to save him all the time.''</p><p>Before Pittsburgh, Luongo had amassed a 3-4-1 mark and an impressive 2.23 goals-against average since being called up from Lowell of the American Hockey League to replace the injured backup Wade Flaherty. His goals-against average is now 3.38, but the Islanders are more concerned with how Luongo bounces back than anything else.</p><p>''He's a confident kid, and talented,'' said Kevin Weekes, the other goalie. ''It's easy to say, but staying positive and having a good work ethic can get you out of most anything.''</p><p>''It's true -- the important thing is to be mentally ready and focused,'' Luongo said. ''That's why I wanted to get back on the ice as soon as possible. Being out there again did get my confidence back up a little bit.''</p></body></html>
