<p><strong></strong>NOW we know why Bobby Bowden kept Peter Warrick on the Florida State team: Warrick is a phenomenal wide receiver.</p><p>Warrick and Michael Vick, Virginia Tech's outstanding freshman quarterback, put on one of the most compelling performances in the history of the Sugar Bowl in a game being played for the national championship.</p><p>In Florida State's 46-29 victory, Warrick set the Sugar Bowl record for points scored (20). He caught touchdown passes of 64 and 43 yards; he ran a punt back 59 yards for a touchdown; he caught a 2-point conversion.</p><p>Vick tied the Florida State defense in knots with his running, which accounted for 97 yards, and passing, which accounted for 225 yards more. He threw a 49-yard touchdown pass and scored on a 3-yard run.</p><p>But Warrick emerged as the star, and the game's most valuable player. His performance capped a season that saw him humbled on a national scale, beginning on Oct. 7, when Warrick and a teammate, Laveranues Coles, were arrested on a charge of felony grand theft for paying $21.40 for $412.38 worth of clothing at a department store in Tallahassee, Fla. Coles was thrown off the team. Warrick was suspended for two games and reinstated after he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor.</p><p>After starting the season as one of the Heisman Trophy favorites, Warrick failed to get enough votes to be among the finalists in December. Yet by the fourth quarter on Tuesday night, a staccato chant of ''Peter Warrick'' resonated throughout the Superdome. Was it a concession to winning at all costs, or the signature of forgiveness?</p><p>Warrick returned to Florida State for his senior year with the idea of winning a national championship and graduating. He achieved both goals. Next stop: the National Football League.</p><p>Now the million-dollar question becomes what will become of Peter Warrick? How will he handle the pro sports culture of opulence, in which survival often depends on strong character and common sense? With no paternal Bobby Bowden or anyone else to shield him, no one to cover for an errant decision, everything rests on Warrick's ability to make good judgments. This has not been his forte, and notoriety only seems to cloud the issue.</p><p>Yesterday, Bowden described Warrick, from Bradenton, Fla., as the sort of wide-eyed country kid.</p><p>''I think the big reason Pete came back last year he was wary about going into the big-time life,'' he said. ''I don't think Pete was eager to go to New York or Los Angeles or St. Louis or New Orleans or wherever he's going to have to go to play.</p><p>''He's from a small town down there in Florida,'' Bowden said about Warrick's arrest, ''and he's got a small town in Tallahassee. If you watch him closely, do you see how naive he is? He's a small-town young man.</p><p>''The thing that happened to him might be the best thing that ever happened to him. Maybe he learned such a great lesson that when he gets in these other towns where temptation is everywhere, maybe he's learned to say no.''</p><p>You wonder.</p><p>Late in the third quarter, Florida State was leading by 28-23 and driving for the knockout punch. Chris Weinke completed a 12-yard pass to Warrick, who tried to outmaneuver Ronyell Whitaker, a Virginia Tech defensive back. As Warrick went out of bounds, the two players exchanged shoves. All the official saw was Warrick shoving Whitaker. Florida State was penalized 15 yards for a personal foul. On the next play, Weinke's pass was intercepted. Seven plays later, Vick lead Tech into the end zone for a 29-28 Tech lead.</p><p>''I'm standing on the sideline thinking, 'That was stupid, what I did,' '' Warrick said. ''I just got mad and frustrated when I caught the ball and went out of bounds. He hit me in my face; I retaliated and hit him back in his face. But you know how that goes. They always catch the person that throws the second punch.''</p><p>That's precisely the point of Warrick's three-month ordeal: committing the act is one thing, getting caught is another. Warrick was caught in the department store three months ago and nearly ruined his career. He was caught on Tuesday and could have cost his team the game and the national title.</p><p>Each time his athletic ability has saved the day. In October, Bowden took Warrick back. On Tuesday, Florida State answered Virginia Tech's challenge with a touchdown.</p><p>Warrick had a great performance on Tuesday. Maybe that should set the tone for his new year and new career.</p></body></html>
