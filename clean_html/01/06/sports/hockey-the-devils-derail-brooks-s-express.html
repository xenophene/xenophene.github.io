<p><strong></strong>The Devils came up with the right formula tonight to blunt Pittsburgh's weaving, open skating style that Coach Herb Brooks has instituted since he took over nearly a month ago. The Devils beat the Penguins, 3-1, to put them atop the Atlantic Division.</p><p>''We mentioned before the game to play in a certain way,'' said Martin Brodeur, who had an inspiring performance in goal for the Devils with 24 saves. ''We were disciplined everywhere on the ice, and we were patient. We knew they are playing good hockey with their new coach.''</p><p>The Penguins have been playing their best hockey since Brooks replaced Kevin Constantine as coach 13 games ago with Pittsburgh six games under .500. The Penguins have brought hockey excitement back to this city for the first time since Mario Lemieux's retirement three seasons ago. This was only the fourth loss in the 13 games under Brooks for the Penguins (17-18-3).</p><p>''It's little variables that come together,'' Brooks said of Pittsburgh's improvement under his leadership. ''It's really a credit to the players. To make up six games in this league is tough.''</p><p>Brooks is the ideal coach for the Penguins. He has been the strongest advocate of the so-called European style that emphasizes skating and finesse, the elements that brought success to the Russians two decades ago.</p><p>Craig Patrick, the general manager of the Penguins, hired Brooks, the two having worked together with the United States team that created the ''Miracle on Ice'' in the 1980 Olympics.</p><p>The Devils (23-12-5) played a typically unexciting road game and extended their unbeaten streak to six games (4-0-2), their longest such stretch this season. They minimized their mistakes and neutralized Jaromir Jagr.</p><p>''When you play against the best player in the league,'' said Bobby Holik, referring to Jagr, ''you have to get good play from everyone and we did that. The few mistakes we made, Marty was there to save us. He can't make 15 great saves a game, but he can make five.''</p><p>The Devils played with discipline and patience even through they fell behind on Aleksei Morozov's sixth goal of the season, and fourth against the Devils, with 4 minutes 9 seconds left in the first period.</p><p>Patrik Elias tied the game with his 11th of the season, 3:10 into the middle period, when, from the left side of the crease, he converted a rebound from a shot by Petr Sykora.</p><p>Randy McKay scored the winner for the Devils at 2:32 of the third period with a shot from the right circle that beat Jean-Sebastien Aubin through the legs before Sykora sealed it with an empty-net goal with 4.7 seconds left.</p><p>McKay played with a great deal of urgency after the coaches decided to give him a day off in the overtime victory in Ottawa two days ago to rest his bumps and bruises.</p><p>''I was talked into it,'' McKay said. ''I thought we played a great character game at both ends of the ice, and now we have a chance to complete a good trip.''</p><p>McKay was referring to Thursday night's game in Buffalo that will conclude a four-game trip for the Devils.</p></body></html>
