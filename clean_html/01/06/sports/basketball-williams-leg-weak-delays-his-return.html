<p><strong></strong>This was the day when Jayson Williams was supposed to rush into the Champion Center and add heart, fire, spirit and humor to the resurgent Nets and their push toward a .500 record. For the past several months, the Nets and Williams, who has been on the sideline since breaking his right leg last April 1, had looked forward to his return in the first week of January.</p><p>But as had happened twice before, Williams's comeback has been postponed. General Manager John Nash announced today that a series of strength tests on Monday revealed that Williams's leg is not strong enough to withstand a return and that the center will be out for at least another six to eight weeks.</p><p>''His leg isn't strong enough to take the rigors of N.B.A. basketball, so he's not cleared to practice,'' Nash said. ''The doctors will re-evaluate him in about six to eight weeks but he's got a sufficient strength deficiency in the surgically repaired leg and we'll see how it goes when he gets examined next.''</p><p>Dr. Russell Warren, who operated on Williams in both April and September, and Dr. Mike Kelly, the Nets' team physician, have told the club that Williams's leg and knee, which had loose particles removed from it four months ago, are completely healed. What is holding him back now is a lack of strength.</p><p>Williams, who did not make himself available for comment, will continue to rehabilitate the leg with his personal trainer, Rich Snedaker, who in September questioned predictions of a January return. In anticipation of practicing this month, Williams concentrated more on conditioning than on strength training the past 30 days, and he was told by his doctors on Monday to reverse his priorities.</p><p>''He was doing a lot of running and cardiovascular training but along the way he kind of leveled off in his strength,'' Nash said. ''As a result, they're going to focus more on trying to get strength back into that leg.''</p><p>This is the third time that Williams has had his hopes of a return dashed. After having five screws and a plate inserted into his right leg in a four-and-a-half hour surgical procedure on April 2, it was announced that Williams would be ready to compete in training camp in October. When he had to have his knee operated on in September, the date was pushed back to the start of the regular season in November.</p><p>At the time, Williams predicted a December return, and when it became apparent that it would not happen, accepted the team's new date of early January. Now he is looking at March or April.</p><p>''I think it's really hard for him, maybe more so than for most guys, because he's such an emotional part of our team and I think he'd like to be a leader,'' Nash said. ''But it's hard to lead when you're not playing.''</p><p>The thought that Williams, who signed a six-year, $90.75 million contract last January, will not return until next season has always lingered in the background, and that notion seems to be gaining more validity each day.</p><p>But Nash believes that Williams will play this season. ''Is it possible that he misses the whole season? Yes,'' Nash said. ''But I think we all look forward to his return. I believe he'll be back at some point this year. It's kind of foolish when you start 2-15 to talk about playoffs, but it would be irresponsible at this stage not to think that we can be a playoff team. And if we get into a playoff drive come April 1 and he's available, I'd like nothing more than to have him and his toughness available to us. And of course if we got into the playoffs, where it really becomes a grueling half-court situation, his presence would be of great value.''</p><p>Coach Don Casey was always skeptical of a January return, and many of Williams's closest friends and teammates, after watching him work out, thought he needed more time for rehabilitation.</p><p>Kendall Gill said: ''I could tell when he worked out that he wasn't ready. I could tell that his leg was still weak by the way he was jumping, and he was still limping a little bit when he was running, so it doesn't surprise me at all.''</p><p>REBOUNDS</p><p>JOHN NASH said the backup point guard SHERMAN DOUGLAS might be lost for the season because of a lesion on his left ankle. Douglas can either have surgery or attempt to return in about six weeks without being operated on. Douglas, who has been on the injured list since Dec. 28, will receive a second opinion this week. ''It will be somewhere between six weeks to season-long,'' Nash said of Douglas's recovery period. . . . X-rays on the sore neck that kept KENDALL GILL from playing Tuesday at Indiana were negative, and the guard-forward is expected to play Friday against Vancouver. . . . Coach DON CASEY said that the rookie EVAN ESCHMEYER played well enough in his debut to warrant receiving more time against Vancouver.</p></body></html>
