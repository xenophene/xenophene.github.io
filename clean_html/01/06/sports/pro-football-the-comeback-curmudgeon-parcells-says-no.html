<p><strong></strong>Bill Parcells said yesterday that he would not return as the Jets' coach, even though Bill Belichick suddenly quit Tuesday, just one day after being named Parcells's successor.</p><p>''I am pretty adamant about not doing that,'' Parcells said. ''What I said the other day is what it's going to be.''</p><p>Parcells made the statement even though the players want him back, the coaches want him back and the fans want him back, too, at least judging by the response at the last regular-season game on Sunday when they shouted, ''One more year!'' And for all anyone knows, the new owner -- whoever that will be -- will spend more than $600 million to buy the team and will probably want him back, too.</p><p>Parcells was reached in his office between meetings yesterday and would only comment briefly on the club and his future. But he reiterated his statement of Monday, when he stepped down after running the Jets for three years, insisting that he would not coach football again.</p><p>However, Parcells said, ''I'm on the job.'' He is still the team's chief football operations officer, and in that capacity, he said, he would be working to find and hire a new coach.</p><p>But a highly placed club official said yesterday that no coaching move would take place until the new ownership was in place. Apparently, that will not happen until the trustees of the estate of Leon Hess meet next week to approve one of the team's two suitors. Then that potential owner would have to be approved at a league meeting in New York on Jan. 18.</p><p>Parcells remained in command of the operations by holding a meeting yesterday of all his coaches at the Jets' training complex in Hempstead, N.Y., where he told them of his plans to continue searching for another coach.</p><p>Among the potential replacements are two coaches from Parcells's Jets staff -- his longtime friend Dan Henning, and Al Groh, who coached with Parcells with the Giants and the Patriots. Parcells has repeatedly praised the job Henning did with the quarterbacks Vinny Testaverde and Ray Lucas. Highly praised coordinators from around the league who might be attractive include Dom Capers of Jacksonville and Gary Kubiak of Denver.</p><p>Belichick was at home yesterday, repeating his contention that the only reason he had stepped down one day into his tenure was because of the uncertainties surrounding the Jets.</p><p>''Maybe you can answer this for me,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''Who's going to own the Jets? What's Steve Gutman's role in this? What's Bill Parcells's role in this? Maybe someone else has the answers. I don't.''</p><p>Gutman, the club president, has contended that those questions were addressed 10 months ago in a meeting with the late Leon Hess, and that Belichick had understood the answers.</p><p>Belichick acknowledged yesterday that in his news conference Tuesday he was ''a little long winded in the beginning. What I was trying to do was answer some questions and give a little background.''</p><p>Asked about his coaching future, Belichick said: ''I haven't thought about it at all. All I can deal with is the situation that's at hand.''</p><p>He is widely believed to be interested in moving to the New England Patriots. But when asked about that possibility or his potential role there, he said ''I don't know anything about that.''</p><p>''This is not about that,'' he said of his resignation. ''This is about my situation with the Jets, and it's not tied to anything else.''</p><p>There was also turmoil at the Patriots' headquarters. The Patriots dismissed Pete Carroll on Monday, and within an hour a club vice president sent a fax to the Jets asking for permission to interview Belichick to be the team's coach and general manager.</p><p>That set in motion a chain of events that led to Belichick's resignation, his lawyer threatening a grievance against the Jets for not allowing him to interview with New England, and Jets' front-office people muttering about New England tampering with Belichick before he was named head coach. But as of late yesterday, the league had received neither a grievance from Belichick against the Jets, nor one from the Jets against the Patriots.</p><p>The league has already upheld the Jets' right, according to the contract, to forbid another club from talking to or hiring Belichick, setting the stage for a a replay of the 1997 face-off when the Jets and the Patriots dueled for weeks over Parcells's services.</p><p>National Football League Commissioner Paul Tagliabue eventually helped broker a deal between the two teams that allowed Parcells to move to the Jets in return for draft choices sent to the Patriots. Now it seems that the Jets are expecting the same from New England; if the Patriots want to sign Belichick, they will probably have to work out a deal with the Jets. ''If someone else wants Bill Belichick, I'm pretty sure they're going to have to pay,'' said a highly placed Jets official.</p><p>Meanwhile, New England went about its business as if Belichick would not be available. Yesterday, the Patriots interviewed the Raiders' defensive coordinator, Willie Shaw, for the head coaching post. They were expected to interview the Ravens' offensive coordinator, Marvin Lewis, today.</p><p>One of the Jets, offensive tackle Jason Fabini, used the words ''bizarre'' and ''weird'' many times in describing the events of Monday and Tuesday.</p><p>He recalled Parcells telling the entire team he was stepping down, that Belichick would replace him.</p><p>''I thought it was weird that after Coach Parcells retired, that Coach Belichick didn't at least address the team,'' Fabini said. ''After Parcells said what he had to say and left the room, there was a lull of 10 or 15 seconds. We're waiting for Coach Belichick to come in and address us, and tell us something, which was sort of weird, you know. After a while, we just got up and left.''</p><p>The next day, Fabini was in the trainer's room watching television and what he thought was going to be Belichick's first public comment as the new coach. Instead, Belichick resigned. ''I called Jumbo,'' said Fabini, speaking of teammate Jumbo Elliott. ''He didn't know what was going on. He thought I was lying to him. I said, 'John, have you turned on the TV at all?' ''</p><p>EXTRA POINTS</p><p>The Jets will have the 18th pick of the draft with their 8-8 finish. They wound up playing the league's toughest schedule.</p><p>Moves Unsettling to Players</p><p>Several Jets players said yesterday that the upheaval in the Jets' coaching hierarchy was an unsettling development that had put them in a wait-and-see situation. Bill Belichick, the heir apparent to Bill Parcells who suddenly resigned on Tuesday, engendered tremendous respect by the secondary, who regarded him as a coach who could somehow always figure out a problem. Two cornerbacks who played for him were rueful at the turn of events.</p><p>''One of the reasons I re-signed with this team was the coaching,'' said Ray Mickens. ''I felt comfortable in the scheme we were using with Coach Belichick. I might have thought twice about it.''</p><p>Another member of the secondary, Marcus Coleman, suggested that this could affect his negotiations for a new contract as he enters free agency. He has been offered a deal paying about $4 million a year.</p><p>Chad Cascadden, the linebacker, added: ''I assumed Bill Belichick would be taking over and the transition would be smooth. But it's still the same team and the same players. We'll just wait and see.''</p></body></html>
