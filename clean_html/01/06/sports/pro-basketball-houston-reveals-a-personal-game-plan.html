<p><strong></strong>When Allan Houston came to the Knicks in 1996, he set a goal. It was not a modest one, and he kept it to himself. He also set intermittent goals, like earning a spot on the All-Star team and playing in the Olympics, but he kept the bigger goal in the back of his mind.</p><p>''I wanted to be the best shooting guard,'' Houston said after practice today, the memory of his 37-point performance against the Boston Celtics on Tuesday night still fresh in his mind.</p><p>Houston has been named to the United States team for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. And while he currently sits third in the voting among Eastern Conference guards behind Allen Iverson and Eddie Jones, Houston is a good bet to either be voted in by the fans or added to the roster by the coaches.</p><p>As far as being the best shooting guard, the first step came when Michael Jordan opted for the golf course. The rest is up to Houston.</p><p>''You set goals because you never know; you may exceed them,'' Houston said. ''You just keep working hard, come to play hard every day. I learned that from Joe Dumars. Come to play, get the job done, and at the end of your career you might say, 'I had a pretty good career.' ''</p><p>Houston is already further along than his detractors would have believed when he arrived from Detroit with the talent but seemed a bit too Midwestern polite to exist in New York. And even a year ago, after proving himself in the postseason, there were still questions about whether he would disappear behind Latrell Sprewell.</p><p>But 31 games into the season, Houston is leading the Knicks in scoring with 21.2 points a game starting beside Sprewell (19.0).</p><p>On a team that features a future Hall-of-Famer in Patrick Ewing and a fearless gunner in Sprewell, Houston has become the Knicks' most deadly weapon in the fourth quarter. He scored 14 fourth-quarter points against the Celtics, and for the season he is the Knicks' best shooter in the final period, converting 47.2 percent from the floor, including 42.9 percent from 3-point range.</p><p>''Yeah, I've always wanted to be that guy and I'm definitely conscious of it,'' Houston said. ''I don't think you should put pressure on yourself to do it. You have to get to your spots better, make your moves sharper, and just raise your level. And if you make or miss, at least you put yourself in the best possible situation. I think every good team and possibly great team has to have a couple guys they can count on at that time.''</p><p>Houston, who was a secondary weapon behind Grant Hill in Detroit during his first three years in the league, seemed hesitant to be that when he joined the Knicks. Without the assertiveness to take charge down the stretch, Houston often watched from the bench while John Starks played the crucial fourth-quarter minutes.</p><p>''Even if he's struggled to a certain degree in the first three, I'm still confident he'll make shots late,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ''There aren't too many guys you can count on consistently to deliver in the fourth quarter. There just aren't many. I have our guys stats, and a lot of our guys are very much down in the fourth quarter. Not because they're not clutch, but defense is heightened. That's why you have to have a game that can play against great defense. And he has a game that can do that.''</p><p>Chris Childs, who joined Houston in New York the same summer, added: ''The first year, no, he didn't have the mentality. The second year, a little bit. He didn't have the confidence necessary. But he worked so hard on his body. Now he wears guys down. We were talking about it today. In the fourth quarter, he wants it. That's money time. The ball is going to be in Spree's hands or his hands. He's just been able to raise his game in the fourth quarter.''</p><p>That used to be the time Jordan would take over and break hearts. Houston is still far off from the Jordan comparisons, settling for trying to be the best shooting guard in the game today. And that means an intermittent goal: his first All-Star Game appearance.</p><p>''Even if I had five All-Stars on my team, I set the goals, whether it's All-Star Game, or finals, or whatever,'' Houston said. ''I kept that in the back of my mind as things I wanted to do, and I just didn't let go of those. And only God knows what's going to happen. You have to just keep your faith in him and yourself and let everything else happen.''</p><p>REBOUNDS</p><p>CHRIS DUDLEY was hit in the mouth during a collision with ANDREW LANG in practice and left to see a dentist.</p></body></html>
