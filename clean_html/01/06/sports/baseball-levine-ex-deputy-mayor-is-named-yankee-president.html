<p><strong></strong>The Yankees formally announced yesterday that Randy L. Levine, who left his post as a deputy New York City mayor this week, has been hired as the club president. Levine, once a member of baseball's Players Relations Committee, management's labor relations unit, has known George Steinbrenner for years, and he joins the Yankees without any specific responsibilities.</p><p>Levine is likely to oversee the Yankees' operations during the forthcoming arbitration season, when they delve into potentially prickly negotiations with shortstop Derek Jeter, the closer Mariano Rivera and others. It has not been determined, according to several club officials, whether Levine will be involved personally in contract talks, such as assuming direct contact with Jeter's agent, Casey Close. Currently, the Yankee executive Mark Newman is taking the lead in discussions with Close. But Levine carries great influence with Steinbrenner and it is safe to assume that he will play a significant role.</p><p>The Yankees indicated in their news release that Levine will not appear before the mayor's office on any Yankee matter, ''in accordance with the appropriate ethics rules.''</p><p>But others in the organization figure that in due time, Levine will serve as a conduit with the city, as the team pursues either a new ball park or renovations to Yankee Stadium. ''Randy Levine is a highly skilled negotiator with an extraordinary breadth of expertise in both baseball and labor matters,'' Steinbrenner said in a statement. ''Randy's unique talents and experience will make him an invaluable asset to the New York Yankees.''</p><p>Levine, 44, has been named senior counsel in the New York offices of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, a Washington law firm, and he will continue in this position while he works for the Yankees. Levine served as the labor commissioner for New York City in 1994 and 1995.</p><p>Other Yankee officials were at City Hall yesterday, where they announced the team would donate $100,000 to aid the victims of the recent floods and mudslides in Venezuela. The Yankees made a similar gesture last year, donating $200,000 to residents of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, who were devastated by Hurricane Georges.</p></body></html>
