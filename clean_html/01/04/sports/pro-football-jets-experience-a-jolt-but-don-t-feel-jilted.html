<p><strong></strong>The players said Bill Parcells had tears in his eyes when he said goodbye today.</p><p>''And then he dropped the microphone and left,'' linebacker Dwayne Gordon said.</p><p>Virtually every player was surprised -- even stunned -- that Parcells had left the Jets on a high note.</p><p>On Sunday, the Jets acted as if they had made the playoffs after a fourth straight victory against a playoff-contending team enabled them to finish the season at a respectable 8-8.</p><p>The players believed Parcells, who will remain with the Jets as a consultant, would return as coach. Instead, he brought them all together in the auditorium in the team's complex and concluded his valedictory by reading a poem written in 1934 by Dale Wimbrow.</p><p>Titled ''The Guy in the Glass,'' the poem is often used as a motivational tool and is about a person looking at himself clearly. It has been quoted in Dear Abby, and by Falcons Coach Dan Reeves. And today the poem was referred to by Parcells as ''The Man in the Glass,'' with a 20-line text that somewhat modernized the 1934 version.</p><p>The last lines of the poem -- and Parcells's last words to his players -- were:</p><p>But your final reward will be heartaches and tears,</p><p>If you've cheated the man in the glass.</p><p>The news began to sink in, and the players voiced their reactions.</p><p>Quarterback Vinny Testaverde, whose status as a National Football League quarterback was greatly elevated by his one full season with Parcells, seemed mildly shocked by Parcells's departure.</p><p>On the other hand, Testaverde has a long relationship with Bill Belichick, who became the Jets' new head coach today after serving as the team's defensive backs coach as well as its defensive coordinator.</p><p>In fact, it was Belichick who, as the Cleveland coach, rescued Testaverde from the futility of Tampa Bay in 1993.</p><p>''He's been a head coach already and he knows the team,'' Testaverde said when asked about Belichick. ''He's a lot like Coach Parcells: the practice schedule, the way he can get in your face if he has to. I think there will be very little change.''</p><p>Quarterback Ray Lucas, the special-teams player whom Parcells felt had the makings of something more, and clearly did, said: ''I don't know if I'm surprised. We don't fall off too much, but still, we're going to miss him a lot.''</p><p>Keyshawn Johnson, the gifted wide receiver, said he understood what Parcells was trying to tell the team with his emotional reading of the poem. ''If you just don't have it, you don't have it,'' Johnson said. ''You have to be true to yourself.</p><p>''If there was an outsider coming in, I'd probably think there was a red flag. But dealing with Bill Belichick? He's my man.''</p><p>Aaron Glenn contemplated life without Parcells and said: ''He'll still be around. That gives you some sense of security.''</p><p>Cornerback Otis Smith, who also played for Parcells in New England and whose 1999 season was ended early by a broken collarbone, said: ''This is not the end of a legend, but the start of something new. I don't know whether I'll be part of it. But Coach Parcells did a lot for players and nonplayers alike. He's a man of his own destiny.''</p><p>Tight end Fred Baxter was one of 13 players from Parcells's first Jets team of 1997 whom the coach had asked to stand in the auditorium.</p><p>''I was just happy he was coming back,'' Baxter said. ''He'll still be around.''</p><p>Romeo Crennel, the defensive line coach, who was saying goodbye to players in the locker room, contended there would be no significant changes in the coaching staff. Most of the assistants go back with Belichick to his Giants days of the 1980's and 1990, a time when Parcells, with Belichick as his defensive coordinator, won two Super Bowls.</p><p>For Jason Fabini, a second-year tackle who was an instant starter under Parcells, there was simply resignation about his coach's decision to step down.</p><p>''It's what he wanted to do and he did it,'' Fabini said.</p><p>Glenn saw what happened in New England, where Pete Carroll was dismissed today by the Patriots after three frustrating years of trying to follow Parcells's footsteps.</p><p>''It'll be hard on Bill Belichick,'' Glenn said. ''I put this in the same category as the Pete Carroll situation. But you only put pressure on yourself. I don't think Bill Belichick has to put pressure on himself. He's already a good coach, and he knows it.''</p><p>Understandably, it wasn't just current Jets who were reacting to Parcells's departure today. Billy Ard, who played guard for the Giants on Parcells's first Super Bowl winner, said: ''I'm going to call him next week and make him laugh. I'll say, 'You have a chance to take your phenomenal name and bring it two steps higher. You're a Jersey guy; I want to you to think about becoming the Rutgers coach.' ''</p><p>Ard's fellow lineman Bart Oates, who has two Super Bowl rings, said of Parcells: ''His expectations were very high because he was a very demanding coach. But except for the strike year of 1987, I've never seen a Parcells team underperform.''</p><p>Phil McConkey, the wide receiver and punt returner who won one Super Bowl with Parcells, said: ''Every time we punted in practice, he was standing two inches away from me. I think I was the best punt-catcher in the world, but I wasn't good enough for him. That kept me focused.''</p><p>And then there was Harry Carson, the Giants linebacker who was a mainstay on many Parcells teams. He was asked just what made Parcells so good.</p><p>''He knew how to motivate players to do what he wanted them to do,'' Carson said. ''Everybody can't do that, but he has a feel for how he wants things done. He projected a certain image to the media, but that wasn't always what he projected to his players.''</p></body></html>
