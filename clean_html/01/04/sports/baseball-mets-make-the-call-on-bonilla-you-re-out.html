<p><strong></strong>Bobby Bonilla guaranteed that he would become a major distraction if the Mets did not play him regularly in the 2000 season. Bonilla played cards with Rickey Henderson in the clubhouse during the final innings of the tense 1999 National League Championship Series. He once threatened to fight Manager Bobby Valentine. The Mets always wondered what he would do or say next.</p><p>Now they do not have to worry anymore. After more than a month of negotiations, the two sides agreed to restructure the final year of Bonilla's contract so he would be placed on unconditional release waivers, become a free agent and eventually get his $5.9 million salary.</p><p>Although General Manager Steve Phillips and Dan Horwits, Bonilla's agent, refused yesterday to discuss specifics of the agreement, one person with knowledge of the conversations said Bonilla's money would be deferred. This person said the Mets would not pay Bonilla for several years, perhaps as long as a decade, so that they can invest the money and reduce their losses. The move also gives the Mets enhanced payroll flexibility for 2000.</p><p>Neither side is weeping over this divorce.</p><p>''I think everybody realized that it was in everyone's interest to make a deal that was satisfactory for all parties, everybody with their own reasons why it makes sense,'' Phillips said. ''It's something I think that all parties benefit from. Therefore, everybody was willing to cooperate in the deal.''</p><p>Bonilla was acquired from the Los Angeles Dodgers for the ineffective reliever Mel Rojas in an exchange of high-priced, unwanted players after the 1998 season. Bonilla batted .160 with 4 home runs and 18 runs batted in over 119 at-bats last season and was throttled by tendinitis in his left knee.</p><p>The Mets could not trade Bonilla because of his huge contract and because any team with interest in the hefty, often-injured 36-year-old figured he would be released by the Mets at some point. Because Bonilla still wants to play regularly, it made sense for him to defer the money and make himself more enticing at a much cheaper price to another team.</p><p>''We don't have to document all of the events between Bobby V. and Bobby Bo last year,'' Horwits said. ''It was clear that it was better for both guys if they parted ways.''</p><p>Valentine said that he was ''not totally happy,'' saying that Bonilla is a talented hitter but that the talent did not come to fruition while he was with the Mets. Valentine said that during a meeting in November with the team president, Fred Wilpon, and Phillips, he did not automatically push for Bonilla's release.</p><p>''I said I could live with it,'' Valentine said. ''Fred and Steve said it wasn't necessary. That roster spot can be filled with somebody who is happy to be here and is a willing participant on the team. Bobby Bo made it clear he wouldn't be a willing participant. Clearly, it was the right thing to do.''</p><p>Phillips would not elaborate on how the restructuring of Bonilla's deal affects the 2000 budget, but it definitely helps the Mets. They now have 16 players signed for about $69 million, giving them more flexibility to pursue a free-agent starting pitcher like Juan Guzman. The Mets had several conversations with Tony Attanasio, Guzman's agent, but that was before they acquired Mike Hampton from the Houston Astros.</p><p>''I don't know whether they'll come back to us on Juan,'' Attanasio said. ''It's something that would be interesting.''</p><p>Bonilla had a controversial first stint after signing with the Mets as the highest-paid player in baseball in 1991, and his second trip to Flushing was also volatile. Phillips said he searched for a reason to believe Bonilla would not be a distraction next season but never found it.</p><p>Bonilla made headlines at his charity bowling tournament last month when he told reporters: ''You're all going to love me next year. In the millennium, there will be some fireworks. I want to play.'' Asked if he would be a problem for the Mets if he did not play, Bonilla said, ''Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.''</p><p>While Phillips said Bonilla's divisive comments and card playing were not the only reasons for the agreement, they obviously had an impact. Because the Mets reached the postseason during a 1999 filled with distractions and will probably not have as many again, Valentine said, they could have survived with Bonilla. But Phillips did not want to risk it.</p><p>''There's no benefit for me to criticize, bash or cast aspersions on Bobby for last year,'' Phillips said. ''We had a successful season, and it's time to look forward to 2000 with hope and expectation.''</p><p>And, finally, without Bonilla.</p></body></html>
