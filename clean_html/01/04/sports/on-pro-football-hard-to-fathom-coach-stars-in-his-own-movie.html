<p><strong></strong>This is Bill Belichick. As head coach of the Cleveland Browns from 1991 to 1995, Belichick was known for his single-mindedness. One day he was sitting in a dark room, watching game film, something he seemingly does more often than eating and sleeping, when a National Football League official showed up for a planned visit to speak with the Browns players about various league issues. When he knocked on the open door, Belichick did not answer.</p><p>The official persisted. Belichick finally looked away from the flickering images and told the visitor he did not have time to gather the players in the meeting room, as had been agreed to days earlier. The league official had just gotten the notorious Belichick brushoff, swatted away like an annoying flea. So the official went scrambling through the complex and got the players together himself. Belichick never left the dark room the entire time.</p><p>This is Bill Belichick. Several years ago, one of the Jets' defensive players approached Belichick, the great defensive coordinator, seeking advice on a personal issue. There was no Belichick brushoff. Instead, he helped with the matter, forever earning the player's respect.</p><p>This is Bill Belichick. He is also a businessman. The New England owner, Robert K. Kraft, faxed a letter yesterday morning to the Jets' president, Steve Gutman, and Coach Bill Parcells seeking permission to speak with Belichick -- a Patriots assistant in 1996 -- about the Patriots' head-coaching position because Pete Carroll had been fired. That request was denied, angering Kraft, an official of an N.F.L. team said.</p><p>That anger is understandable. Parcells may have been planning to leave coaching anyway, as he did officially yesterday, but his quick retirement announcement may have been a ploy, a pre-emptive strike to keep Belichick and other Jets assistants from joining Parcells's bitter enemy Kraft and stop a Jets brain drain. This annoyed Belichick, who wanted a chance to at least explore the possibility of joining the Patriots as a football guru like Parcells. And do not underestimate Belichick's desire to get the Patriots and the Jets into a bidding war for his services.</p><p>Belichick is loyal to Parcells as a coach, but they are not close friends off the field, and Belichick has a fiercely independent streak. He is also not crazy about the possibility of Parcells's hovering around the organization like a mother hen.</p><p>And this is Belichick, too, now the head coach and director of football operations for the Jets. Smart. Tireless. Will outwork his opponents. Industrious. The best defensive mind in football. Organized. Has been told he is not a people person. Has been told by players how he, not Parcells, saved this season with his outstanding defensive schemes. Remains hated by one former boss. And remains respected by another former boss</p><p>''My problems with him occurred years ago,'' said Art Modell, the Baltimore Ravens owner, who hired Belichick in 1991 to coach Cleveland. ''It was not a particularly pleasant experience. But that was a long time ago. What happened in Cleveland does not mean it will happen in New York. I'm sure he's changed. That's pretty much all I want to say about Bill Belichick.''</p><p>Giants General Manager Ernie Accorsi was the vice president for football operations in Cleveland when Belichick was the head coach. ''I never had a cross word with him,'' Accorsi said. ''To be honest, I didn't. He was fine to be around.''</p><p>This is the duality of Belichick. What has been consistent is his coaching genius. What is much more difficult to get a handle on is his personality. Talk to one group of people, and they will portray Belichick as a humorless ogre. Talk to others, like Kraft, and they will maintain that Belichick is a considerate, smart coach and a good person.</p><p>The truth may be somewhere in the middle. Belichick is clearly no longer the person who causes steam to come out of Modell's ears. In Cleveland, where his Browns went 36-44, Belichick was a miniversion of Parcells, only he did not possess Parcells's knack for charming at times even those who despised him. He did possess Parcells's occasional wariness and bad temperament.</p><p>That has changed as Belichick, now 47, has evolved into a mature leader. Kraft is close to Belichick and came to like the defensive coach. They built a relationship that has stayed with the Patriots' owner.</p><p>That closeness made Kraft decide to try to hire Belichick after Kraft knew, several weeks ago, that he was going to fire Carroll. And make no mistake -- Kraft was going to give Belichick total control of the organization, authority Kraft was unwilling to give Parcells when he coached in New England. But that is how highly Kraft thinks of Belichick.</p><p>Parcells knew that Belichick was going to leave for New England, and could do nothing to stop him if Parcells stayed on. Suddenly there was a tremendous threat to the house that Leon Hess built and Parcells now treasured. If Parcells stayed as head coach, Belichick would leave for a division rival and take several key assistants with him. Then, one year later, Parcells would retire and the Jets would be without Parcells and Belichick. The team would suffer.</p><p>So Parcells's stepping down not only allowed him to retire and make more visits to the horse track, it also kept Belichick in town and prevented the Jets from taking steps back.</p><p>Belichick walks into a difficult situation, following a legend like Parcells. What Belichick has to hope for is to be George Seifert, who trailed Bill Walsh and his five Super Bowl rings in San Francisco. Seifert won his own championships with San Francisco and is one of the most underrated coaches in the game.</p><p>Belichick's work ethic will get him far. Don't be surprised if he leads the Jets -- sure to be one of the top five teams in the league next season with the return of a healthy Vinny Testaverde -- deep into the playoffs. Belichick, with all of his personalities, is perfect for this franchise.</p></body></html>
