<p><strong></strong>During the preseason, Stephon Marbury shared his philosophy on playing with pain. He talked of fighting through a fractured toe during his second season with the Minnesota Timberwolves in order to reach his goal of playing in every regular-season game.</p><p>''Every day, all I said to myself was: 'I'm going 82. I'm going 82,' Marbury said in October. Being hurt is all mental. You can be hurt and still play. If you're injured, you can't play. I don't deal with hurt. I don't deal with pain. I just play. I've gotten to a point where pain doesn't bother me anymore. I'm just out there hoopin'. You love playing basketball and when you're hurt and you're out there ballin', the pain goes away and you don't feel it until after the game.''</p><p>Marbury, the Nets' star point guard, left practice early yesterday to have a magnetic resonance imaging test taken on his right hamstring, and it was determined that he is indeed hurt, though not injured. The test was negative, and Marbury was given a diagnosis of tendinitis in both hamstrings.</p><p>The Nets' media relations department said it will be decided after today's morning shoot-around whether Marbury will play in the team's game tonight at Indiana (20-9). But because they are aware of Marbury's thoughts on playing hurt, the Nets' coaches and players fully expect him to be in uniform against the Pacers.</p><p>''It was sore,'' Casey said of Marbury's hamstring problem. ''We just wanted to check him out. But I have no reason to believe he won't play.''</p><p>Marbury has apparently played the last two games with soreness in his legs. He told a teammate, Elliot Perry, the backup point guard, a week ago that his right hamstring had been bothering him. Yet he still went out and averaged 18.5 points, 13 assists, 6 rebounds and 4 steals in victories over the Knicks and the Orlando Magic.</p><p>Since missing 15 games as a rookie with injuries to his ankle and thigh, Marbury has become one of the league's budding ironmen.</p><p>Though he had to sit out one game last season while waiting for the three-team trade that brought him to the Nets to be completed, he has not missed a game over the past three seasons because of injury.</p><p>If he does not play tonight, the Nets (12-18) will seem to have little chance of defeating the Pacers. Playing its best ball of the season, Indiana has won five straight games and has a 12-2 record at the new Conseco Field House.</p><p>In the absence of Marbury, Casey said he would move Lucious Harris into the starting lineup at shooting guard and slide Kerry Kittles over to the point. But without Marbury's ability to break down defenders and find the open man, the Nets' entirely perimeter-oriented attack would be rendered all but powerless. CHRIS BROUSSARD</p></body></html>
