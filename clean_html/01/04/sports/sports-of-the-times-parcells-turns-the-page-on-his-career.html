<p><strong></strong>With his commitment of credibility fulfilled, with his personal legacy secure, all that was left for Bill Parcells to do today was to honor Bill Belichick's service, and Leon Hess's trust. All that remained was for Parcells to let the clock run out, without fumbling the handoff of the Jets.</p><p>Parcells said, ''I coached as hard as I could, right to the end,'' and that included his giving Belichick the ball with the best chance of breaking away from Parcells's intimidating presence. Super Bowl musings aside, the timing on this play was perfect, after an 8-8 season that should not be difficult to improve on, and before the detested Robert Kraft could lure Belichick back to New England to replace the fired Pete Carroll.</p><p>North Jersey Renaissance man that he is, Parcells read a poem to his players, and made a promise to the press. ''There'll be no rumors about Bill Parcells,'' he said. ''I've coached my last game.''</p><p>Listening to Parcells at the afternoon news conference made me think back to when Dean Smith stepped down before the 1997-98 season as the basketball legend-in-residence at the University of North Carolina. Smith had two great returning players, Antawn Jamison and Vince Carter, but he abruptly retired, boxing the school in, leaving the job to Bill Guthridge, his longtime aide.</p><p>Guthridge didn't win the title, but Smith's caring manipulation and personal sacrifice forged a smoother transition for an unglamorous man whose entire career was spent in Smith's shadow.</p><p>''I'm not going to be Bill Belichick's shadow,'' Parcells said, meaning that all ''football-related decisions'' will be made by Belichick, and that Parcells, in all likelihood, will not hang around with a fancy title very long.</p><p>Maybe an uncomplicated departure with no recrimination means more when you realize it is your last chance to get one right. Parcells's escape from New England to the Jets three years ago created a quarrelsome mess that had to be cleaned up by the league. Even when he quit the Super Bowl champion Giants in 1991 for legitimate health reasons, Parcells was chided for waiting until May.</p><p>Belichick, who would have been the logical replacement from Parcells's staff, had already moved on to become head coach of the Cleveland Browns. Belichick would have preferred the Giants, and the Giants would have avoided the forgettable Ray Handley era that ushered in a mostly unhappy decade.</p><p>For 15 years, Parcells did it his way, on his clock. He bared his teeth, bullied most everyone in his path. An old man who had come to him with the last, significant request of his life -- make me a winner -- finally humbled the autocratic Parcells. ''I felt a very strong obligation to Mr. Hess,'' he said. ''It's very hard to explain, what that guy was like, how he called me every week, how he was in my corner.'' Parcells let that thought dangle. Just for that moment, his eyes appeared moist.</p><p>Parcells is still two years away from 60, his self-imposed retirement age. He apparently decided he could not put in those 15-hour workdays for Charles Dolan, expected winner of the Jets' ownership sweepstakes, for the glory of the rising cable bill.</p><p>Parcells's mission was to make Hess's laughingstock Jets a team to be proud of. No one would argue that he failed. The Jets weren't quite Cinderella, winning 29 regular-season games but only one playoff game in three years under Parcells. This was apparently enough for the coach, and probably for Leon Hess, too. ''Just to see him after that playoff game last year against Jacksonville -- I can still see what he was wearing, the expression on his face,'' Parcells said.</p><p>Hess didn't live to see Vinny Testaverde go down in Game 1 this season, or Parcells stumble around for answers in the ensuing weeks, or the Jets march behind Ray Lucas back to the threshold of grand expectation. Parcells could have stayed on, chasing a bigger finish, but he doesn't need another Super Bowl ring for the Hall of Fame.</p><p>He understands that. He knows who he is. That's what the poem, ''The Guy in the Glass,'' is all about. Personally and professionally, Parcells said he knew it was over when he left the field Sunday afternoon. It was time, before Kraft moved in, before a new Jet owner arrived to assert his control. It was time to think of Belichick, of the Jets' long-standing continuity, of what was at stake here for people besides him.</p><p>It was time to take a good, hard look at the guy in the glass, in the mirror. Maybe, when Parcells did, he asked himself what Leon Hess would have said was the right thing to do.</p></body></html>
