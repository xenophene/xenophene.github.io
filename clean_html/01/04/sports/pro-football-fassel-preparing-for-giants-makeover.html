<p><strong></strong>In the wake of his first losing season as the Giants' coach, Jim Fassel said today that he expected to receive a contract extension. The team's management was preparing, with some reservations, to extend Fassel's contract, according to people familiar with the thinking of the Giants' ownership and top front-office personnel.</p><p>The team's co-owners, Wellington Mara and Robert Tisch, and General Manager Ernie Accorsi have not met on the subject, and they do not plan to until later this week. But the Giants would like to announce a decision on the status of Fassel's contract, scheduled to expire after next season, within a week. Last month, before the Giants lost their final three games of the season to drop the team's record to 7-9, the owners and Accorsi had informally agreed that Fassel should be offered a contract extension, probably for two years.</p><p>The Giants' late-season collapse has troubled management, and Fassel will be asked to present his plan for reviving the team in a separate meeting with the owners, but any potential stumbling blocks to an agreement are more likely to concern salary or the length of an extension, not whether Fassel deserves to remain as coach.</p><p>Speaking with reporters today, an irritable Fassel ardently promised changes in the team's makeup and he did not rule out changes in his coaching staff. Fassel also indicated that he wanted to avoid coaching in the final year of his contract. ''This job is hard enough without everybody thinking you're on a short leash,'' he said. Asked if he expected to receive an extension, Fassel answered, ''I don't know why not right now.''</p><p>Fassel refused to discuss how many years he would want added to his contract or whether he would accept a one-year extension. ''I know how this organization operates,'' Fassel said. ''We'll meet sometime.''</p><p>Earlier, in a team meeting, players said Fassel sternly lectured them before they dispersed to their off-season homes.</p><p>''He was bitter, and I can't blame him,'' cornerback Jason Sehorn said. ''Coach Fassel is a nice guy, but he wasn't jovial today. He wasn't Santa Claus in there.''</p><p>Safety Percy Ellsworth said: ''He let some things off his chest. He said the direction of the team would be different next year.''</p><p>Fassel delivered a similar message in his news conference, saying he was going to begin testing his players' commitment to winning. ''It's not going to be a pleasure cruise,'' Fassel said. ''I'm going to make changes. There are reasons you get in these situations and I'm going to look at every player and staff member. I'll start by looking at myself. Nobody should be satisfied.''</p><p>Asked if the changes he planned could be termed wholesale or tinkering, Fassel said, ''Somewhere in between.''</p><p>''I don't know that I'm in the mood to tinker,'' he said. ''But I don't know that we need wholesale changes.''</p><p>Fassel said he had not yet decided if there would be changes in his staff. ''I'm not going to rule anything out specifically,'' he said. ''But I set an example for that. I fired myself as a play caller.''</p><p>Reviewing the season, which concluded with six losses in the Giants' final eight games, Fassel had several general observations. He said the Giants had to improve their team speed. ''We have to be more explosive,'' he said. ''That's the way the game is going and we need to stay current with that. It's proven to be a more wide open game.''</p><p>He said he had already met with the team's medical staff to try to determine why the Giants had so many injuries this season, especially broken bones.</p><p>Fassel praised quarterback Kerry Collins, who averaged 293.8 passing yards in the team's last six games, and Dan Campbell, the rookie tight end, whose role was increasing until he tore his hamstring last month. Of defensive end Michael Strahan, Fassel said, ''I don't think he had a productive year.''</p><p>Earlier, without naming anyone specifically, Fassel had said, ''On any team, there are great players and they had better play like great players, because they're getting paid like great players.''</p><p>Strahan signed a record four-year, $32 million contract before this season. But his sack total plummeted from 15 in 1998 to 5.5 this season.</p><p>Fassel also lamented the Giants' turnover ratio; the Giants turned the ball over to their opponents eight more times than they forced opponents' turnovers. ''We have to do something to change that, and I don't care what it takes,'' Fassel said. ''Change that from minus eight to plus eight and I guarantee you it's worth two more wins.''</p><p>But mostly, Fassel seemed dejected. ''I am disappointed,'' he said. ''I would expect everybody to be.''</p><p>EXTRA POINTS</p><p>The Giants, the only 7-9 team in the National Football League, will have the 11th pick in the college draft next spring. . . . JOE MONTGOMERY, the rookie running back, led the team in rushing with 348 yards, the lowest total for a Giants season-rushing leader since BOBBY DUHON had 344 yards during the 14-game season in 1971. . . . In the 28-16 loss to Dallas on Sunday, running back TIKI BARBER had 13 receptions, setting a team record formerly held by MARK BAVARO, who caught 12 passes in a 1985 game. Barber also had 66 receptions this season, which betters the team record 51 for a running back set by FRANK GIFFORD in 1956. . . . Middle linebacker COREY WIDMER missed the season-ending team meeting today to have his back examined by specialists. Widmer was plagued by lower back problems for most of the last two months. . . . Fullback CHARLES WAY said the surgery on his right knee had been successful and that he has been told he will have a complete recovery.</p></body></html>
