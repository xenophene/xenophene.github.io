<p><strong></strong>The Devils knocked Ottawa's starting goaltender out of the game today with two goals on their first three shots and greeted his replacement with another goal two shots later for a three-goal lead barely 12 minutes into the game.</p><p>The outcome appeared beyond question after the Devils took a 3-0 lead so early, but the Senators rallied and tied the game with eight-tenths of a second left to force overtime.</p><p>The stunned Devils were saved, however, by the sparingly used Brendan Morrison, whose goal 2 minutes 52 seconds into overtime gave them a 4-3 victory at the Corel Center. It was only his second goal of the season. Morrison, a 24-year-old center who was scratched in 4 of the previous 6 games and 7 of the previous 10, scored his game winner from directly in front of the net with a rising shot after a pass by Claude Lemieux. The sequence that led to that goal started on the right side of Ottawa's defense with Morrison taking the puck away from Wade Redden.</p><p>''When you sit out for a period of time and you get a chance to play, you want to make the most of it,'' Morrison said. ''A lot of thoughts go through your head. This will give me some confidence to build on.''</p><p>Morrison missed all of training camp and the first nine games of the season as an unsigned restricted free agent. He asked to be traded during his contract dispute, and Coach Robbie Ftorek has used the talented Morrison infrequently.</p><p>''Some guys don't like it when not playing every day,'' Ftorek said. ''He is part of the team, but it's not a fun situation when you're out of the lineup.''</p><p>Scott Stevens, the team captain, said the Devils (22-12-5-2) should have never put themselves in the predicament of having to go into overtime after they built a three-goal lead on their first five shots.</p><p>Ottawa goaltender Ron Tugnutt was yanked after allowing Sergei Brylin's fifth goal of the season and Jason Arnott's 10th on the first three shots he faced. Brylin beat Tugnutt with a shot from the right circle that went in off the goaltender's left skate, at 4:57, and Arnott beat him 45 seconds later with another shot from the right circle.</p><p>Tugnutt was so upset he kept banging his stick against the wall as he headed to the dressing room after he was pulled by Coach Jacques Martin. Unlike other members of the Senators, Tugnutt was not cheered shortly afterward when he appeared on the arena's video screen with his two children with wishes to the fans for the new year.</p><p>Patrick Lalime replaced Tugnutt and was greeted just as impolitely by the Devils. Brad Bombardir gave the Devils their three-goal cushion on the second shot Lalime faced. Bombardir's shot sailed over Lalime's left shoulder from the slot for his second goal of the season.</p><p>But the Senators (19-13-6-2) forced overtime with two goals by Shawn McEachern in the first and second periods and Vaclav Prospal's goal just before the end of the third period when they had an extra attacker against Martin Brodeur.</p><p>''We made it tough on ourselves,'' Stevens said, ''but it's nice to win it at the end.''</p><p>SLAP SHOTS</p><p>The Devils and the Senators have special teams of equal efficiency, both with the man advantage and killing penalties. The Senators entered the game second in the league killing penalties and 12th with the man advantage. The Devils were 3rd and 13th, respectively. But there were no power-play goals in nine advantages in Monday's game, seven by the Senators. . . . The Devils' four-game trip, which began with a tie in Boston on Saturday, will continue Wednesday night in Pittsburgh and end Thursday night in Buffalo.</p></body></html>
