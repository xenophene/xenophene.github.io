<p><strong></strong>Sucker punches in the National Hockey League are becoming very expensive. Gino Odjick of the Islanders found out just how expensive yesterday when he was suspended for eight games without pay for hitting Darius Kasparaitis of the Pittsburgh Penguins from behind on Dec. 30.</p><p>Odjick, a 6-foot-3-inch, 227-pound right wing, will lose $30,867 of his estimated $800,000 salary for smashing Kasparaitis in the face in retaliation for an earlier hit on the Islanders' 18-year-old center, Tim Connolly, during the third period of the Islanders' embarrassing 9-3 loss at the Igloo.</p><p>The suspension was announced following Odjick's hearing in Toronto yesterday afternoon before the N.H.L. executive vice president and director of operations, Colin Campbell, and the vice president for hockey operations, Mike Murphy.</p><p>''The punch by Mr. Odjick was deliberate and resulted in a head injury to Mr. Kasparaitis,'' Campbell said. ''The fact that Mr. Kasparaitis was unable to defend himself as he was looking away from his opponent also was a factor in this decision.''</p><p>The suspension was the second-longest of 22 handed out by the N.H.L. this season. Anaheim's Ruslan Salei was suspended for 10 games for checking Mike Modano of Dallas from behind on Oct. 5. That was the longest suspension since forward Matt Johnson of the Los Angeles Kings was suspended for 12 games for punching the former Ranger defenseman Jeff Beukeboom in the head in November 1998.</p><p>''I did what I did because Tim Connolly represents the future of my team, and I thought we were being disrespected,'' said Odjick, who was initially suspended Friday and who missed Sunday's game against the Philadelphia Flyers pending the hearing. ''But I understand what the league is trying to do and I have a lot of respect for Colin Campbell and Mike Murphy. It's my responsibility to stay ready for when my suspension is over.''</p><p>It was the fourth suspension in the career of the 29-year-old Odjick, who cannot play again until Jan. 17, when the Islanders play host to Ottawa. Odjick, who joined the Islanders on March 23, 1998, was suspended for seven games with Vancouver during the 1991-92 season.</p><p>''Colin has one of the toughest jobs in hockey,'' Mike Milbury, the Islanders' general manager, said. ''I doubt if you'll ever hear a positive reaction to a suspension. But out of respect to his office and ability, we accept his judgment.''</p><p>Odjick, second on the Islanders in penalty minutes with 67 (Eric Cairns leads with 85), socked Kasparaitis in the face with his glove at 11 minutes 28 seconds of the final period, earning a major penalty and a game misconduct. The Penguins were able to score on the ensuing power play.</p><p>Kasparaitis, a former Islander who was suspended for two games on Oct. 20 for elbowing J. P. Dumont of the Chicago Blackhawks in the head, fell to the ice for a few moments after being hit by Odjick, but returned to play another shift. Kasparaitis called the shot by Odjick a ''cheap play'' and ''very dangerous.''</p><p>Afterward, Kasparaitis said he began experiencing a sore neck and exhibited other symptoms of a head injury.</p><p>SLAP SHOTS</p><p>The money GINO ODJICK loses will go to the N.H.L. Players Emergency Assistance Fund, a confidential fund to benefit indigent former players and their families. . . . ROBERTO LUONGO, who was in goal for the loss to Pittsburgh, returns to the net tonight at Nassau Coliseum to face Boston. Luongo is 2-0 against the Bruins, including a victory in his N.H.L. debut. ''I'm looking forward to getting back in the net to redeem myself,'' Luongo said. ''I had a couple of good games against Boston, but that doesn't mean anything going into the game. I just want to go into it with the best preparation I can.'' . . . Captain KENNY JONSSON, a defenseman who has missed two games with a viral syndrome, skated for about 45 minutes of the Islanders' slow-paced, two-hour practice yesterday at Iceworks in Syosset, N.Y., but was doubtful for the game against the Bruins. . . . Defenseman ERIC CAIRNS, who has a back problem, missed practice but will probably play against the Bruins.</p></body></html>
