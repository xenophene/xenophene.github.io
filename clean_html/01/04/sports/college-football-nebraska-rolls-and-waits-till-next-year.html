<p><strong></strong>Bypassed for consideration as this season's national champion, Nebraska spent the 2000 Fiesta Bowl laying a foundation for the next national title by laying waste to Tennessee on Sunday night, 31-21.</p><p>''This is a great step to propel us to next season,'' said Dan Alexander, whose 108 yards and a touchdown led a relentless Cornhusker running attack. Third-ranked Nebraska (12-1) amassed 321 yards, 238 in the second half, and ate up the final 7 minutes 25 seconds of the clock in a replay of its 42-17 manhandling of Tennessee in the 1998 Orange Bowl.</p><p>In that game, Nebraska wound up winning a share of the national championship. That was not possible this year, as the unbeaten teams Florida State and Virginia Tech will meet in the Sugar Bowl on Tuesday night for the unofficial title.</p><p>Nebraska jumped to a 17-0 lead on Sunday night, saw that whittled to 17-14 and then won the game in the trenches with consecutive backbreaking touchdown drives of 96 and 99 yards in the second half.</p><p>''If a team can take you 99 and 96 yards when you're close at 17-14, obviously they're something special,'' said Phillip Fulmer, coach of Tennessee, the defending national champion. ''Two years ago we took the lessons from Nebraska, came back and had an awful fine year the following year. Maybe we can do the same thing.'</p><p>Nebraska quarterback Eric Crouch was named the offensive player of the game, as much for his gritty leadership as for his efficient statistics -- 9-of-15 passing for 148 yards with a touchdown and 64 yards rushing. Crouch, a quarterback with a running back mentality, implied that the tougher team won.</p><p>''There was a lot of talk about us not being a very physical team,'' he said, referring to pregame comments from No. 6-ranked Tennessee. ''I thought that probably wasn't appropriate. We just came out and had to play it on the field. We had to be the most physical team.''</p><p>He said Nebraska's physicality had led to Tennessee injuries. ''It seemed like every five minutes, someone was laying on the ground,'' he said. ''Maybe they weren't in good enough shape -- I don't know.''</p><p>What Nebraska could not prove, however, was that it deserved to be the national champion, its season blemished by a 24-20 loss to Texas. So the Cornhuskers must watch the Sugar Bowl instead of play in it.</p><p>''We're convinced we've got as good a team as anybody,'' Nebraska Coach Frank Solich said. ''But we will go with the system. You've got two undefeated teams playing. We know how it works.''</p><p>Everything worked for Nebraska on Sunday. The running game was led by Alexander, but the blocking back Willie Miller rumbled for 87 yards and Correll Buckhalter added 59 and a touchdown.</p><p>''When they pinned us down twice with deep punts, they forced us into running the ball some, and once we started running, we found out that maybe we can keep running it,'' said Solich, whose club ran on its final 23 plays from scrimmage. ''That's what we ended up doing and we wore them down a little bit. Then, of course, we stopped their running game, and we've been able to do that all year.''</p><p>The Cornhuskers' disciplined defense held Tennessee to 44 rushing yards and picked off quarterback Tee Martin twice, once by safety Mike Brown, the defensive player of the game. Martin completed 19 of 34 passes for 223 yards and a touchdown in his Tennessee farewell.</p><p>''I'd say we got another good lesson tonight,'' Fulmer said.</p></body></html>
