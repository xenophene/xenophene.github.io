<p><strong></strong>Mediocrity would be a step up for the Rangers right now.</p><p>The Rangers' streak without a victory was extended to seven games by Pierre Turgeon and the St. Louis Blues, who won by 5-2 last night at Madison Square Garden. Turgeon extended his point streak to 15 games with a picture-perfect assist before delivering the backbreaking goal at 14 minutes 40 seconds of the third period to give the Blues an insurmountable 4-2 lead. The streak ties Turgeon with Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr for the longest in the National Hockey League this season.</p><p>At 30, Turgeon is enjoying a renaissance. He is playing the way he did for the Islanders in 1992-93, when he had 58 goals and 132 points, before Washington's Dale Hunter ended his postseason prematurely with a shot that seemed to sidetrack Turgeon's career.</p><p>Now Turgeon is back on track.</p><p>''It's nice to win,'' said Turgeon, who has 17 goals and 31 assists in 35 games this season to help St. Louis to the second-best record in the Western Conference. ''I don't know how many years I have left.''</p><p>The Rangers are not having the kind of resurgence Turgeon is. The defeat dropped them to 12-19-7-3 for the season and 0-4-3 with a regulation tie over their last seven games. The Rangers are 11th in the 15-team Eastern Conference, and only eight teams qualify for the playoffs.</p><p>The Rangers are also seven games under .500, matching their worst standing this season. After Turgeon one-timed a slap shot from the right circle under the crossbar for the two-goal lead, the Rangers seemed to all but quit over the final five minutes.</p><p>''There was definitely a letdown at that point,'' the Rangers' Mathieu Schneider said.</p><p>And the schedule does not get any easier for the Rangers, who now face the top team in the conference, the Toronto Maple Leafs, home and away in the next two games.</p><p>''We're not even at the halfway point,'' Coach John Muckler said when asked if he felt the season was slipping away. ''It's too soon to be talking about that.''</p><p>But Muckler did say that the rookies Mike York and Kim Johnsson, who have been two of the Rangers' best players this season, looked tired last night.</p><p>They are not the only ones.</p><p>The Rangers have scored just 15 goals over their seven-game drought, and Petr Nedved does not have any of them. Nedved had an assist last night but failed to score a goal for the 12th straight game. In 34 games this season, Nedved has 27 points on 7 goals and 20 assists.</p><p>Turgeon, on the other hand, has 17 goals this season for St. Louis (23-11-5), and with 2 points last night he has 24 points in his last 15 games.</p><p>The Rangers opened the scoring on their first shot of the game, at 3:22 of the first period, when Tim Taylor chipped a loose puck home for his seventh goal of the season. It was set up by Kevin Stevens, whose centering pass from the left boards was broken up by defenseman Todd Reirden.</p><p>The 1-0 lead did not last long. Lubos Bartecko outskated Johnsson and Stephane Quintal down the ice before putting a forehand-backhand-forehand move on Mike Richter, beating the Ranger goalie on the stick side at 4:53 to tie the score, 1-1.</p><p>The Rangers, meanwhile, went nearly 13 minutes without a shot after Taylor's fluky goal. But even though the Rangers picked up the pace offensively in the second period -- they outshot St. Louis by 16-6 -- the Blues scored goals by Scott Young and Bartecko to take a 3-1 lead.</p><p>''I thought I had the jump,'' said Nedved, who actually seemed to, but who was nevertheless booed every time he touched the puck. ''I was going. And still nothing happened.''</p><p>That has been pretty much the story of the Rangers' season.</p><p>''We're all getting booed,'' Muckler said. ''That's part of the game. People are frustrated. You can understand. We're frustrated. We've got to work our way out of it.''</p><p>SLAP SHOTS</p><p>JOHN MacLEAN scored the Rangers' second goal, his fifth of the season. The goal, a deflection, came on the power play at 17 minutes 15 seconds of the second period after St. Louis had scored three unanswered goals. . . . LUBOS BARTECKO scored twice for St. Louis, while TODD REIRDEN had a career-high three assists for the Blues. . . . DARREN LANGDON has a hernia and will be out at least three to four weeks. He missed his 10th consecutive game for the Rangers. . . . One night after being a healthy scratch for the second time this season, left wing KEVIN STEVENS was back in the Ranger lineup. Right wing MIKE KNUBLE was a healthy scratch for the fifth time in six games. . . . Coach JOHN MUCKLER juggled the Rangers' lines a little, skating MacLean with PETR NEDVED and JAN HLAVAC, and VALERY KAMENSKY with RADEK DVORAK and ALEXANDRE DAIGLE.</p></body></html>
