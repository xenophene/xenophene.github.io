<p><strong></strong>He knows why he lost the Heisman Trophy. He knows how he dropped the Biletnikoff award for the nation's best wide receiver. He knows how he undid all the admiration that he had earned last winter when he decided to skip the National Football League draft to return to Florida State for his senior year. Still, Peter Warrick also knows that he is just 60 minutes away from having a pretty good year.</p><p>He returned to college for two reasons: to earn a degree and to win a national championship. Three Saturdays ago, far from the cheering crowds, Warrick pulled down the first, when he marched in commencement exercises and was awarded a degree in political science.</p><p>In the Sugar Bowl Tuesday night on national television, Warrick hopes to help the top-ranked Seminoles march down the field against Virginia Tech. He wants to hand the man who stuck by him, Bobby Bowden, his first undefeated season in 34 years as a head coach.</p><p>He needs to be a part of Florida State winning its second national title. ''This is the reason I came back, to win a national championship,'' he said. ''There's nothing else in the world that I want more than this right now.''</p><p>Warrick also knows this should have been a more triumphant week for him -- that he ought to be talking about having won the Heisman rather than having lost it, of looking forward to the N.F.L instead of escaping to it.</p><p>In September, however, Warrick's season of celebration turned into one of survival. He and a teammate were caught on a surveillance camera at a Dillard's department store in Tallahassee, Fla., getting a lot for very little. In collusion with a store clerk, Warrick and Laveranues Coles paid just $21.40 for $421.38 worth of designer clothes. Warrick was arrested on a felony count of grand theft.</p><p>Though he told the police investigators that he had participated in the scam and admitted it was wrong, Warrick turned his bad decision into a public misstep when he uttered a remarkably inappropriate rationale for his actions in his first public comments. ''It's not like I shot the president,'' he said.</p><p>He was suspended for two games while his lawyer tried to resolve the case in a way that satisfied both law enforcement officials and the Florida State administration. The university community was deeply divided on how to discipline Warrick.</p><p>The university's president, Talbot D'Alemberte, rejected a proposed plea agreement that would have had Warrick plead guilty to a felony, finish the season and serve jail time in the spring. He was deluged with dissenting e-mails and a letter from at least one Florida state senator. When Warrick eventually pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in exchange for community service, he became one more flash point for the debate over whether society (or a coach) allows athletes to live under different standards.</p><p>All week Warrick has had to answer questions about the incident. ''If I would have known the consequences would be like that, I would have never done it,'' he said.</p><p>Warrick also said he thought that the news media ''were trying to make an example out of me.'' He added: ''They did a good job. A great job.''</p><p>But some comments have reflected the deep faith and commitment to do the right thing that Bowden and his teammates say are the foundation of Warrick's character.</p><p>''I've been through a lot,'' Warrick said. ''Getting through the trouble, I bounced back from it and it takes a real man to do that. Now I can stand up in front of a crowd and tell kids to learn from my mistake. Trouble is easy to get into, but hard to get out of.''</p><p>Warrick concedes that he has been publicly humiliated. He was serenaded with chants of ''jailbird'' by Clemson fans his first game back from the suspension. In Florida, ''Heistman'' T-shirts, featuring the famous trophy figure shooting a stiff arm in defense of a shopping bag, were a best seller.</p><p>Not only did he lose his Heisman front-runner status, but more than 900 Heisman voters made sure he was not allowed in the same room with the famous trophy. He finished sixth and was denied a trip to New York with the winner, Ron Dayne, and four other finalists.</p><p>Even though Warrick finished the regular season with 71 catches for 934 yards and 8 touchdowns, the player many people believe is the most exciting in college football was not even named the best at his position. Stanford's Troy Walters won the Biletnikoff award.</p><p>''When I got into trouble, there were consequences,'' Warrick said. ''I thought I paid my dues to the world, but I guess I didn't. When I didn't get to go to the Heisman, it hurt me, but everything happens for a reason. I'm playing for the national championship.''</p><p>Just as he ordered his cap and gown early in September for his anticipated graduation, Warrick has been thinking about winning a title for a long time. In fact, for exactly 365 days, after Florida State lost the national title to Tennessee in a Fiesta Bowl in which Warrick caught just one pass.</p><p>He stunned Bowden and his teammates when, after a day of anguished prayer, he announced that he would return to Florida State for his senior year despite being a certain top-five N.F.L. pick. His loyalty was returned by Bowden after the Dillard's incident. Coles, who had been in trouble before, was kicked off the team. Bowden said Warrick had been nothing but a solid citizen and deserved a second chance.</p><p>Warrick has apologized, paid restitution for the clothes and will do his community service. And as long as he learns from his mistake, Bowden says, Warrick's debt to him or Florida State is paid. ''I want him to enjoy his last college game,'' the coach said. ''I don't want him to think he has to go out there and make up for all he has done bad.''</p><p>His teammates, too, bestowed on Warrick an honor that perhaps is more precious than the postseason hardware he fumbled on his own. They voted him one of three team captains for the national title game.</p><p>For now, that is enough for Warrick. He is a graduate and a captain with one more goal to reach. He has owned up to his mistake, but now is ready to let it go. ''It will go away, eventually,'' he said. ''I'm through apologizing. It's behind me.''</p></body></html>
