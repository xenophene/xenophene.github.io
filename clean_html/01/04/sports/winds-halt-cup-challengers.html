<p><strong></strong>A day after strong winds took a heavy toll on equipment and nerves in the Hauraki Gulf, stronger winds forced cancellation of all three races today in the America's Cup challenger semifinals. The semifinals, scheduled to end next Tuesday, will now be extended an extra day.</p><p>According to the rules, no race may begin if the wind is continuously greater than 18 knots for a period of five minutes during the run-up to the start. Today, the wind speeds were consistently higher than 20 knots with gusts exceeding 30 knots.</p><p>America True and Nippon Challenge were the first to turn back after agreeing not to race. Next were Le Defi Francais and Stars and Stripes, the early leader in the semifinals with a 2-0 record. Finally, the day's showcase race between America One and Prada was called off. The races will be run Wednesday, giving crews more time to repair Monday's damage to five of the six boats -- all but Stars and Stripes.</p></body></html>
