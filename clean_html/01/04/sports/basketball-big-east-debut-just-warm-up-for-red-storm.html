<p><strong></strong>St. John's had looked forward to last night's game against Pittsburgh as a measuring stick in the Big East, a league that began conference play last night with no member having a losing record.</p><p>But the rulers were packed away early at Alumni Hall, made as obsolete as an abacus by an overmatched and overwhelmed Pittsburgh team. The undersized and undermanned Panthers merely provided warm bodies for what amounted to a controlled -- and not very, at that -- scrimmage for the Red Storm, as they thrashed Pittsburgh, 82-58.</p><p>If St. John's (9-2, 1-0), so undersized and undermanned itself that the starters remained in until just a few minutes remained, was wondering how it would perform against a comparable team, it did not find out in its league opener. While the Panthers may look like mirror images of the Red Storm, they are not as talented and not as experienced; Coach Ben Howland said his sophomore center Chris Seabrooks has played so little, it is as if he is starting three freshman.</p><p>Pitt has lost the senior forward Isaac Hawkins, one of the league's best rebounders, to injury and has had to rely almost exclusively on the junior forward Ricardo Greer, who had 20 points.</p><p>And so the depth of the St. John's rout was astounding. Playing a witheringly aggressive zone press defense, the Red Storm forced more Pittsburgh turnovers in the first half (17) than points allowed (14), victimizing, in particular, the freshman guard Brandin Knight, who had five turnovers in the first half.</p><p>Erick Barkley, the St. John's point guard who is still gauging his recovery from an early-season knee injury, outscored the Panthers, 16 to 14, in the first half on the way to a 25-point night.</p><p>In one span, the Panthers turned the ball over on 9 of 10 possessions, providing the impetus for St. John's circus-like plays in transition. The Panthers finished with 25 turnovers and for much of the game struggled merely to get the ball over the midcourt line.</p><p>''It was a good way to start the league,'' Coach Mike Jarvis said. ''It was really good because we put ourselves in a position to use our big asset, which is our quick hands.''</p><p>On one such possession, Barkley grabbed a loose ball and launched a pass to Reggie Jessie, who was streaking toward the paint. Jessie kept running, caught the ball and spun it behind him for the trailing Bootsy Thornton, who elevated for a dunk that gave St. John's an early 18-4 lead.</p><p>Barkley and Thornton had their best all-round games of the season, combining for 37 points, 12 assists and 10 steals, and Barkley had a career-high 11 field goals. But as spectacular as that and other plays were, they soon became a blur of sprint-pass-score as the fast break evolved into a breakdown.</p><p>The Red Storm led by 31 points at the half, 45-14 and could have built the winning margin much higher, for they were ahead by 38 points early in the second half before they eased up on the attack. The Panthers shot just 25 percent from the field and less than 10 percent (1 of 11) from 3-point range in the first half before taking advantage of St. John's reduced use of the press to shoot 75 percent (18 of 24) from the floor in the second half. The Panthers still had not broken the 20-point barrier with just 15 minutes to play.</p><p>Jarvis said afterward that a game like this at least indicated his team was capable of concentrating and remaining disciplined even in the face of an easy time. For the Panthers, the indications are more ominous. They play Connecticut, the No. 2 team in the nation, on Saturday.</p><p>''There aren't any cupcakes in the Big East,'' Greer said.</p><p>BIG EAST TIPOFF</p><p>The St. John's game against Pittsburgh kicked off this season's Big East schedule. While every team in the conference began the week with a winning record, don't be deceived. Few teams -- save second-ranked Connecticut -- have faced any competition. Seton Hall (8-2), with one of the best recruiting classes in the nation on the way, is off to its best start since 1995-96 and will be host to Villanova (6-3) tonight. Syracuse, at 9-0 and ranked seventh, will get its first true test when it is host to Rutgers (8-4) tomorrow. Syracuse returns all five starters, but has played every game, against subpar competition, at home.</p><p>Providence (7-6), which lost a shocker to Fordham Sunday, will be host to Georgetown (8-3) tomorrow, but the most intriguing game of the week figures to take place tonight when Notre Dame -- with TROY MURPHY, perhaps the most spectacular player in the league -- visits Connecticut, whose only loss came to Iowa in the Coaches Vs. Cancer tournament at Madison Square Garden. Murphy, a sophomore, is ninth in the nation in scoring, averaging 23.3 points.</p></body></html>
