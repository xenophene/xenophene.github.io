<p><strong></strong>Two head coaches were dismissed, another resigned and his top assistant took charge, a playoff quarterback was benched, another is injured and was replaced, and a Pro Bowl tackle is injured and will miss the postseason in what evolved into a black-and-blue barrage of National Football League moves yesterday.</p><p>Pete Carroll of the New England Patriots and Ray Rhodes of the Green Bay Packers were dismissed after their teams failed to reach the playoffs. Bill Parcells resigned as the Jets' head coach and his longtime defensive coordinator, Bill Belichick, is the new Jets leader.</p><p>In Buffalo, quarterback Doug Flutie had started all but one of the 16 regular-season games but was benched in favor of his backup, Rob Johnson, for the Bills' wild-card playoff game at the Tennessee Titans on Saturday.</p><p>Detroit quarterback Charlie Batch reinjured his right thumb, on his throwing hand, and cannot play in the Lions' wild-card playoff game at the Washington Redskins on Saturday. Gus Frerotte, a former Redskin, will start for Detroit.</p><p>And Tony Boselli, a four-time Pro Bowl left offensive tackle for Jacksonville, tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee against the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday and was lost for the playoffs. The Jaguars, however, have an extra week to solve the problem because they have a bye this weekend.</p><p>Last season, five head coaches were dismissed on the day after their regular-season finales. This year, the action was nearly as furious, and more head coaches -- chief among them Mike Ditka in New Orleans -- are expected to be let go later this week.</p><p>Carroll earned a 27-21 record in three seasons in New England. But each year under his leadership, the Patriots faded. They produced a 10-6 record and reached the second round of the playoffs in his first year, were 9-7 and reached the first round in his second year, and crashed to 8-8 this year after starting 4-0 and 6-2.</p><p>Carroll replaced Parcells, who moved to the Jets, and inherited a Patriots team that had reached the Super Bowl the previous season and lost.</p><p>''The New England Patriots fans have come to expect a quality football team and quality results, and we have not achieved that,'' Robert K. Kraft, the Patriots' owner, said. ''We need a momentum change.''</p><p>Carroll said, ''I'll forever be disappointed that we didn't win more.'' He is expected to resurface soon as a defensive coordinator, perhaps for Washington or the Seattle Seahawks.</p><p>Rhodes, who previously coached Philadelphia for four seasons, coached only one season in Green Bay. He, like Carroll, replaced a Super Bowl coach, Mike Holmgren, now coach of the Seahawks. Rhodes's Packers finished 8-8 but had two three-game losing streaks.</p><p>''I'm not an excuse maker; we can blame ourselves,'' Rhodes said about his dismissal and about missing this season's playoffs. ''We missed out on too many opportunities.''</p><p>He did so in a city and with a team where history consumed him.</p><p>''This is a great franchise; this is the cornerstone of this league,'' Ron Wolf, Green Bay's general manager, said. ''Every time I walk down these hallways, I am reminded of the great tradition. This is a great responsibility. It's all about winning and losing -- that's why they keep score.</p><p>''I was hoping this would be a smooth transition. But after the second three-game losing streak, it was clear it was not. Our players did not respond. There was a different pulse that was reflected in our play. I had a long discussion with Ray last night and he was not pleased, but I think he understands. I wanted a disciplined, tough, hard-nosed coach, and that is what it takes in this business. We didn't have that here. Is he a different coach than I thought he was? Yes. We underachieved.''</p><p>Neither Kraft nor Wolf named a timetable for selecting a new coach.</p><p>In Buffalo, Flutie had started the Bills' first 15 games. Johnson started against the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday to give Flutie rest for the playoffs. Now that Johnson has passed for 287 yards, 2 touchdowns and no interceptions and completed 24 of 32 passes in Buffalo's spirited 31-6 victory over Indianapolis, Flutie will get extra rest.</p><p>''My feeling is, with either one of them we can win,'' Bills Coach Wade Phillips said. ''It was a tough decision. It wasn't a haphazard thing.''</p><p>Batch has spent much of this season on the sideline with his injured thumb, and he cracked it again, on a helmet while throwing a pass, in Detroit's 24-17 loss at Minnesota on Sunday. Frerotte beat Washington, 33-17, late in the season at Detroit, but the Lions will play a team that has traditionally dominated them. Detroit is 0-19 in Washington, including 0-2 in playoff games. The last one was a 41-10 loss in the 1992 National Football Conference championship game.</p><p>Boselli was blocking on a routine running play in the third quarter when he injured his knee. Jacksonville beat Cincinnati, 24-7, and won home-field advantage through the American Football Conference playoffs, but the victory was definitely dimmed. Ben Coleman, who will replace Boselli, has had a gimpy knee all season.</p><p>''We've had our share of injuries, and this is obviously a huge blow to our team,'' Jacksonville Coach Tom Coughlin said. ''It's a shock today, but once the time comes, I think we'll be ready.''</p></body></html>
