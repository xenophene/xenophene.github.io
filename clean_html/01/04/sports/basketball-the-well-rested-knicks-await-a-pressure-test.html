<p><strong></strong>If the Knicks are droopy in the aftermath of their four-day break, the sneaker-screeching defense of the harassing, pressing and stress-inducing Boston Celtics will be about as welcome as a noisemaker to a hangover victim.</p><p>There are gentler ways to begin a new year than by playing the Celtics at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday night.</p><p>The Knicks' first game since their shaky victory against the Wizards in Washington on Thursday will be a challenge to their vulnerabilities.</p><p>In two games against the Celtics this season -- one a miserable loss and one a narrow victory -- the Knicks have been hurt off the dribble by Kenny Anderson, slow to scoop up the loose ball and outrebounded by a combined 99-68.</p><p>There seems no fool-proof way to approach the Celtics. But Coach Jeff Van Gundy will start Charlie Ward, even though the guard has had trouble containing Anderson.</p><p>And there are bound to be times when Van Gundy will put the big backcourt of Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell on the floor, even though it could result in a turnover calamity against the Celtics' occasional full-court pressure.</p><p>''I think we can deal with the pressure,'' Sprewell said today after practice. ''But if it's hurting us, obviously we have to get Charlie back in there to handle the ball and get Allan and I in some spots we're more familiar with. I think we'll try to go big, especially if we're getting beat on the boards. This team killed us on the boards the last time we played them. If we're having problems rebounding, I'm sure Jeff will try to do something to give us more rebounding and more size. The biggest thing is when they go full-court pressure, we have to attack. We have to go at those guys and hurt them and get quick easy scores.''</p><p>It seems odd to be so concerned about a Celtics team that entered its game against the Cleveland Cavaliers tonight with an unspectacular 12-16 record. But the injury problems that haunted the Celtics during their 2-7 stretch -- when they lost to the Knicks, 99-97, on Dec. 12 -- have healed.</p><p>Paul Pierce, Vitaly Potapenko and Danny Fortson -- all absent for different parts of the last month -- are back to play their part in Rick Pitino's chaos-causing strategy.</p><p>''Boston is the only team that will pick you up full court,'' said Sprewell, who can recall facing Pitino teams in college. ''It reminds me of playing those guys in Kentucky. As soon as they make a basket, they're right up in your face. They're waving everywhere and got guys running at you from all different directions.''</p><p>At least the Knicks are healthy enough to face the Celtics. But they are not exactly as intact as they had hoped. Chris Childs has not practiced since the birth of his daughter on Jan. 1, and is not a sure bet to be back in time for Tuesday's tip-off.</p><p>While his teammates and coach understand his needs to be with his family, there was some expectation that he would be back today.</p><p>''It's not like it's his first,'' Marcus Camby said with a smile. ''It's a little extra vacation for him.''</p><p>Childs is a part of a second-team unit that tries to inspire the team with a burst of energy off the bench. There have been times when Childs and Camby have pounced onto the floor and changed the entire tone of the game. Childs also gives the Knicks a more active defender against Anderson.</p><p>''I'm hopeful,'' Van Gundy said of Childs's return. ''But I don't know.''</p><p>There is an air of uncertainty hanging over the Knicks that goes beyond Childs. So far, there have been no signs that the Knicks are prepared to rebound better, guard the dribble with quicker feet or protect the 3-point line with sharper attention.</p><p>In the end, the Knicks' four-day break could leave them more energized to combat their weaknesses or just as sleepy and uninspired as they were entering the new year.</p><p>''I think we've had two good days of practice,'' Sprewell said. ''Any celebrating guys did on New Year's, I hope they got it out of their system.''</p><p>REBOUNDS</p><p>At the end of August, JEFF VAN GUNDY attended a Jets practice and took careful note of the way BILL PARCELLS handled his team. ''It was one day, so it's hard to draw any conclusions,'' Van Gundy said after Parcells held a news conference Monday to announce that he was stepping down from his coaching responsibilities. ''But you could tell he had a great relationship with his players, but there was a great edge to it, too. He said some funny things but also got his point across.''</p></body></html>
