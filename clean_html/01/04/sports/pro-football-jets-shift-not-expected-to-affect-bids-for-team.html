<p><strong></strong>Ever since Leon Hess hired him to resurrect the Jets three years ago, Bill Parcells has been the team's unchallenged center of attention. But he said at the outset that he would probably go no more than three or four seasons before he handed the coaching job to Bill Belichick.</p><p>That scenario was accepted several months ago by potential buyers of the Jets, making it unlikely that Parcells's resignation yesterday would throw the bidding into disarray or cause the two remaining suitors to reduce their enormous offers.</p><p>Charles F. Dolan and Robert Wood Johnson IV have each bid at least $600 million for the Jets, with Johnson expected to make a revised offer before a winner is declared, most likely at the end of this week. Dolan is believed to have bid $615 million. National Football League owners are to vote on the sale on Jan. 18.</p><p>The bidders preferred elevating Belichick and keeping Parcells as an adviser, rather than losing Belichick to the New England Patriots and having Parcells coach the Jets for one more season, according to people involved in the sale process.</p><p>''They're not buying a person, they're buying a team,'' said Bob Tisch, a co-owner of the Giants. ''The new owner will be there long after Parcells or any coach is gone.''</p><p>Tisch paid $75 million for his half of the Giants in March 1991, two months before Parcells resigned as the Giants' head coach. ''I assumed he would stay,'' Tisch said, ''but even if I knew he was leaving, I would have paid the same thing.''</p><p>Robert McNair, who acquired the new Houston expansion franchise for $700 million last October, said: ''I wouldn't think his departure would impact the price, if I were looking at it. If Parcells were completely gone, that might impact it, because you'd have to go back in and rekindle the enthusiasm. He's a force on the field, but he'll be a force off the field, too.''</p><p>No buyer would make a huge long-term investment based only on Parcells, despite the formidable role he has played in resurrecting the once-moribund franchise. But his success was among the assets prominently noted in the prospectus prepared for the sale of the Jets.</p><p>''I wouldn't seek relief because a coach leaves,'' said Art Modell, who agreed last month to sell 49 percent of his Baltimore Ravens. ''But if I felt so strongly about his value, I'd ask to be relieved of my obligation to buy the team.''</p><p>The departure of Parcells as head coach will relieve Johnson or Dolan from dealing with the enormous power Parcells was given by Hess, who died last May. Belichick's contract does not include a clause that would risk his resignation if the owner interfered in his decisions, as Parcells's contract did, according to one of the people involved in the sale.</p><p>Parcells did not detail his future plans, beyond saying he would consult with Belichick. He said Belichick would make all football decisions. If Parcells leaves the Jets entirely, he can try a return to broadcasting.</p><p>After leaving the Giants, he worked as a studio analyst for NBC's N.F.L. studio show in 1991 and as a game analyst in 1992. His studio work suffered from almost weekly rumors about his return to coaching. He relaxed and improved during his game work.</p><p>It was unclear just how interested the networks might be in Parcells. CBS's studio program was revamped this season, and the network would not hire Parcells to replace Phil Simms or Dan Dierdorf as one of its top analysts. Fox's Hollywood studio show would be a long weekly trek for Parcells, and John Madden is secure as Fox's top game analyst.</p><p>At ABC Sports, officials have voiced consistent support for the Al Michaels-Boomer Esiason pairing on ''Monday Night Football.'' But if a third announcer were added, Jimmy Johnson would be a likely candidate, if he left as coach of the Miami Dolphins. When Johnson was a Fox studio analyst from 1994 to 1996, he was better and livelier than Parcells.</p><p>An ESPN spokesman said there would be interest in talking to Parcells. But would Parcells commute weekends to Bristol, Conn.?</p><p>Parcells's resignation came one day after CBS's ''60 Minutes'' ran a long-delayed profile, much of which was taped at training camp last July. A final interview by Mike Wallace was conducted two weeks ago.</p><p>''We really expected him to go the Super Bowl,'' Wallace said. ''But when the team was 1-6, it would have been stupid to put the piece on. So we said, 'Let's wait and put a new preface on it,' and it ended up being wonderful.''</p><p>Delaying the segment from Oct. 3 until Sunday, Wallace said, ''ended up being perfect timing, even more perfect knowing what we know now.''</p><p>Wallace said he did not sense during his recent interview with Parcells that his retirement from coaching was imminent. ''I thought maybe his ego would keep him around,'' he said.</p><p>In response to a question from Wallace about coaching for another season, Parcells said ''you can't fool yourself'' about the commitment needed to keep coaching.</p><p>Parcells used similar language yesterday to discuss his decision to resign. ''You have to have the committed energy to do it at the level that I would want to do it at,'' he said.</p><p>It will take less of Parcells's energy to continue as the spokesman for local Cadillac dealers. Steve Kurland, a Nanuet, N.Y., dealer, said: ''He transcends an awful lot. People like him and he's believable. He could run for mayor.''</p></body></html>
