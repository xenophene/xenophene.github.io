<p><strong></strong>Percy Ellsworth was stuffing his belongings into a garbage bag, searching through the piles that filled his locker for a souvenir, a reminder of his time with the Giants. Today, he was still a Giant but was well aware that it might be the last time that he, and many of his teammates, set foot in the Giants' locker room.</p><p>Ellsworth, a free safety, is an unrestricted free agent, and he figures to draw interest from teams based on his six interceptions this season. It is believed that his price tag is likely to venture into a range the Giants will not match, especially with last year's first-round draft pick, Shaun Williams, waiting his turn behind Ellsworth.</p><p>But Ellsworth is hardly alone. There are eight unrestricted free agents on the roster, including cornerback Phillippi Sparks and offensive tackle Roman Oben, and nine restricted free agents, a list that includes some who are likely to remain, like running back Tiki Barber, safety Sam Garnes and punter Brad Maynard.</p><p>But as the players filled garbage bags after listening to a stern speech from Coach Jim Fassel, it was clear from the mood that contracts were not the lone factor in who would stay and who would go. After a disappointing 7-9 season concluded on Sunday, it was hard to say that anyone was safe.</p><p>Players like running back Gary Brown, defensive tackle Robert Harris and linebacker Marcus Buckley could find themselves casualties of the salary cap.</p><p>''I really don't know what the future of the team is,'' Ellsworth said. ''With things like this, you can go two ways. You can break up the team or you can just add a few more Pete Mitchells and Kerry Collinses to the team like we did in the off-season. I'm one of the ones that thinks that this team is not that far off. A couple of impact guys like those guys coming in and doing their jobs, and this team can do it.''</p><p>Oben, who is likely to be given the ''franchise player'' tag, added: ''The only thing that's left is the evaluation of what they think of players like myself to Percy, to people that aren't free agents, and decide where they can help the team next year. That's going to be the determining factor. If you can help the team win, then they'll find a way to make you a part of this team.''</p><p>There were various reasons the team reached this point, including injuries and inexperience. But most said Fassel's message that the finger be pointed at each individual rather than at others seemed to sink in.</p><p>''It's easy to point fingers and say this is wrong and that's wrong,'' said Collins, a quarterback. ''What it takes is for everybody to look at themselves, individually, and Jim hammered that point home. If it means coming in the off-season and working hard, whatever. Just start with yourself.''</p><p>Linebacker Jessie Armstead was one of the last players left in the room, and he still had business to attend to. He said he was going to speak to Fassel immediately about their midseason exchange of words; Armstead said Fassel silenced him after Armstead had made some comments critical of the offense. While Armstead maintained that the issue still needed to be addressed, now and maybe in a month when he had cooled off, Fassel was adamant that the issue was a misunderstanding.</p><p>''I think it can be worked out,'' Armstead said. ''You're not dealing with a guy that's a selfish guy. You're dealing with a guy that's been taught to respect his elders, no matter who it is. I show disrespect to nobody, but it gets to a point where you have to be a man about the situation and everybody sits down and talks about it, what can help this organization, not about what can help Jessie Armstead or Jim Fassel.''</p><p>Fassel replied: ''Let me say this, and I'm going to put this in exact, straightforward terms, then I'm over with it. I have never once told any player to zip his lip and don't say anything. Anybody that thinks I said that doesn't know what I said. Second of all, I believe that players putting pressure on players is healthy. I've always thought that and I've always encouraged it. And you don't have to be a leader to do that. Lastly is that if anybody -- anybody -- thinks that that had any reason to do with us not playing well, he is on a way different page than me.</p><p>''I'll straighten it out. Jessie and I talked about it. It's his honest feelings. I like Jessie. Jessie is a great football player and a good man. He's my kind of player. I'll go to war with him anytime. If that's his feelings, I've got to straighten it out with him.''</p></body></html>
