<p><strong></strong>How far Major League Baseball has come in 100 years. In 1900 the National League snubbed the newly named American League, denying the upstart equal status, even refusing to acknowledge the league's existence. In the first year of this new century, the leagues are not only considered equal but they also have become blurred by the elimination of separate league offices and league presidents.</p><p>In the first year of the century just ended, the Players Protective Association was formed and won significant concessions, without a work stoppage, from the A.L. president, Ban Johnson: no player would be traded, sold or sent to the minor leagues without his written permission, disputes would be submitted to binding arbitration, and a three-year limit would exist on the clause that enabled clubs to reserve players. It was enlightened thinking unmatched to this day.</p><p>But later that year, at the same meeting at which they ignored the other league, N.L. owners rejected the efforts of the association's lawyer to gain similar rights for players in that league. In some ways, baseball has not come very far at all.</p><p>At the turn of the century 100 years ago, Cy Young had run off a streak of nine successive seasons in which he won more than 30 games three times and more than 20 six other times. But he didn't win the Cy Young award even once.</p><p>When players' achievements are discussed or listed in record books, they are usually done so in the context of ''modern'' times, that is, from 1900 on. Most people tend to ignore what players did before 1900, even if they were two-century players.</p><p>It is not very likely that sometime later in this century a new modern era beginning in 2000 will be recognized, although the way hitters have been hitting home runs and teams have been scoring runs in recent seasons, this era may have to be considered separately from the past to account for offensive inflation.</p><p>Whatever line of demarcation was created to separate pre- and post-1900, events that occurred before should not be ignored. Some had an impact on post-1900 developments; some were just interesting in their own right.</p><p>For eight seasons before 1900, the National League had 12 teams. But a month before that season began, the league reduced its membership to eight teams, lopping off Baltimore, Cleveland, Washington and Louisville. Cleveland, known as the Spiders, finished the 1899 season with a 20-134 record, the worst for number of losses and winning percentage (.130) ever compiled by what would be classified as a major league team.</p><p>The downsizing of the league left New York, Brooklyn, Boston, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, St. Louis and Chicago. Those eight cities would be the National League for the next 53 years, until the Braves moved from Boston to Milwaukee in 1953.</p><p>Anticipating the elimination of one of the two teams he owned, Barney Dreyfuss ''traded'' 13 of his Louisville players for four of his Pittsburgh players. Included in the trade were four players who would one day be in the Hall of Fame -- shortstop Honus Wagner, outfielder Fred Clarke and pitchers Jack Chesbro and Rube Waddell.</p><p>Sluggers Lost in Time</p><p>Tommy Leach was one of the players in the Louisville-Pittsburgh trade who didn't reach the Hall of Fame, but he holds a distinction nonetheless. Leach led the National League in home runs in 1902, and his total of six was the lowest total for a home run champion in the 20th century. These days that is a routine week for Mark McGwire.</p><p>In 1894 Bob Lowe of the Boston Beaneaters became the first player to hit four home runs in a game. He hit only 13 others during the season. That same year his teammate Hugh Duffy hit .438, which remains the highest average any player has ever had. Duffy also edged Lowe for the home run title, 18 to 17.</p><p>At that time the home run record was 27, the number Ned Williamson hit for the Chicago White Stockings (Chicago's American League team would later appropriate the name) in 1884. The third baseman whacked 25 of his home runs at the team's home park, Lakefront Park, which happened to have the shortest distances of any park ever, 196 feet to left field, 180 to right.</p><p>Before that season, balls hit over those fences were doubles. They were doubles after that season, too. Williamson, who had hit a total of eight home runs in six previous seasons, connected for a total of 29 in six subsequent seasons. If that record can be discounted as a fluke, the record-holder before Babe Ruth made home runs his province beginning in 1919 was Harry Stovey, a first baseman, who hit 14 home runs for Philadelphia in 1883.</p><p>Neither Stovey nor Williamson took his home run bat into the 20th century so neither has been a part of baseball lore. Bill Duggleby is not either, but the Philadelphia Phillies pitcher should be. He registered his best season in 1901 when he compiled a 20-12 record, but that is not why he should be remembered. He hit a grand slam in his first major league at-bat in 1898.</p><p>What is so special about that? No other player has hit a grand slam in his first major league at-bat. Bobby Bonds is the only other player who hit one in his first game, but his shot, in 1968, came in his third time at the plate. Ruth, Aaron, Mays, McGwire -- no one did what Duggleby did.</p><p>The Iron Men</p><p>Joe McGinnity pitched his first major league game, for Baltimore, in 1899. He won 28 games, just as he did the following season for Brooklyn, which in the first month of the new century purchased him and five other players from cash-strapped Baltimore. But it was with the New York Giants that the right-hander earned his reputation and nickname, Iron Man.</p><p>In August 1903 McGinnity pitched both games of doubleheaders three times and all three times gained complete-game twin victories. He started 48 games that season and completed 44. He won 31 times (he won 35 the following season). He pitched 434 innings, the most anyone pitched in the 1900's.</p><p>Cy Young won 511 games, more than anyone won in the 1900's or the 1800's. Young played from 1890 through 1911 and completed 749 of the 815 games he started, a 92 percent ratio. He was a 20-game or 30-game winner 13 times in a 14-season span, missing only in 1900, when he had a 19-19 record. He gained 267 of his victories before 1900. Only 28 pitchers in history have won more than that total.</p><p>A Star and a Holdout</p><p>For more than a quarter-century pitchers have been pampered and treated as gingerly as if they were made of Tiffany glass. From four-man rotations teams have gone to five. Pitch counts are used as a safeguard against pitchers being overworked, but in reality as a way for managers to protect themselves against charges of overuse.</p><p>No one ever pampered Amos Rusie. A strong right-hander, Rusie was primarily an 1890's guy who won 246 games in nine seasons. That's an average of 27 victories a season. In only one of those seasons did he fail to win at least 20 games. That was the only year he did not pitch for the Giants. He won more than 30 in four successive seasons.</p><p>Rusie struck out more than 300 batters in each of his first three seasons with the Giants, 1890, '91 and '92. No pitcher would have 300 strikeouts in three different seasons until the 1960's, but Sandy Koufax did not do it three years in a row.</p><p>Twice Rusie made as many as 62 starts. In each of his first three seasons with the Giants, he pitched 500 or more innings. Pitchers today need three seasons to accumulate 500 innings.</p><p>Rusie was as tough on management as he was on opposing batters. He held out the entire 1896 season because the Giants' owner would not give him the extra $200 he wanted. But he wound up getting what would have been his entire salary for that year because National League teams contributed to a fund to make up the $3,000 Rusie lost.</p><p>The other owners were not being charitable. They wanted to avoid Rusie's lawsuit in which he was seeking free agency. What a concept. Owners continued avoiding it for the next 80 years.</p><p>Rusie returned in 1897 and pitched himself to a 28-10 record and led the league with a 2.54 earned run average. The next season he was a 20-game winner for the eighth consecutive time. But again he and the Giants tangled over the salary he should receive.</p><p>This time he sat out two seasons, 1899 and 1900. It was as if Pedro Martinez had sat out last season and would do the same next season. After the 1900 season the Giants traded Rusie to Cincinnati for Christy Mathewson, who had pitched for the Giants as a rookie that year but had been drafted by the Reds for $100 after the Giants sent him back to the minor leagues.</p><p>Rusie was only 29 years old, but he would stage no more holdouts. He started two games for the Reds and relieved in one, and his career was over. Mathewson? He won 20 that season and would win 373 games in a career in which he was a 30-game winner four times and a 20-game winner nine other times, winning 22 or more games for 12 successive seasons.</p><p>Birth of the Yankees</p><p>At the turn of the century, the team that would dominate the 20th century didn't exist. The New York Yankees, ne Highlanders, came into existence for the 1903 season as part of the peace pact between the N.L. and the A.L. The A.L. agreed to stay out of Pittsburgh, and the N.L. agreed to let the A.L. have a New York team.</p></body></html>
