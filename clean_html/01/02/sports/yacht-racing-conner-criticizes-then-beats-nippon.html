<p><strong></strong>Before the semifinals of the Louis Vuitton Cup began, Dennis Conner was highly critical of the Japanese boat's decision to practice with the America's Cup holders from New Zealand.</p><p>This afternoon Conner dealt a much more serious blow to Nippon Challenge, and this time it came on the water instead of in a news conference. Racing in relatively moderate winds that, in theory, should have favored the Japanese, Conner's boat, Stars & Stripes, was consistently faster and more polished in transition around the marks, winning by 55 seconds.</p><p>The other two races on the opening day of the semifinals that will produce an America's Cup challenger were considerably less surprising, as Italy's Prada Challenge defeated America True by one minute, and America One defeated the French entry, Le Defi Francais, by 22 seconds.</p><p>It was the first race for America One's new boat -- USA-61 -- and though the new boat is now 1-0, it is not certain that the skipper Paul Cayard will be reassured by his yacht's performance in the downwind legs against Le Defi, the most surprising of the six semifinalists. The French won all three of those legs by convincing margins, but America One's performance into the wind made the difference.</p><p>Prada, the best-funded of all the challengers, was more consistently dominant in ITA-45, the boat it used in the first two rounds last year but then abandoned for the third round. After considerable debate, the Italians elected to return to their first boat for the semifinals. America True, which represents the San Francisco Yacht Club, does not have that luxury. It has only one boat.</p><p>So does Stars & Stripes, but today, against the Japanese, Conner's crew demonstrated that it had put the time between the third round-robin and the semifinals to good use, despite the major distractions of Christmas and New Year's Eve.</p><p>After winning the start -- never an easy task against Nippon and its Australian skipper, Peter Gilmour -- Stars & Stripes quickly built a lead of several boat lengths after the Japanese opted for a quick port tack and the Americans stayed left.</p><p>''We wanted the left side of them coming off the starting line,'' said Ken Read, the Stars & Stripes helmsman. ''Up the first beat, they tacked away, and we continued and waited for the left shift we thought was coming.''</p><p>After that wind shift came, they never surrendered their lead, not even when a problem with their spinnaker pole track kept them from maximizing their performance on the final leg.</p><p>''We're thrilled with that,'' Read said of the victory. ''Without a second boat these last couple weeks, we didn't know if we improved the boat. But I think today we proved that we made some good decisions.''</p><p>It remains to be seen whether Nippon's decision to return to its first boat -- a decision that America True's helmsman, John Cutler, termed ''a shock'' -- was a wise decision. After losing to Stars & Stripes in the first two rounds of the round robin in this boat, Nippon switched to its new boat in the third round and had the best record of any of the challengers: 8-2.</p><p>But Gilmour and his crew apparently believed that the older boat, with modifications, would be better suited to the expected lighter conditions.</p><p>''I don't think Nippon's slow,'' Read said. ''We got a good jump, and we didn't give them any breaks. Tactically, this was our best race of the regatta.''</p><p>Each of the six semifinalists will race twice against the others over a 10-day period that could extend beyond that if the mercurial Auckland weather does not cooperate. The top two teams will advance to the Vuitton final that will produce Team New Zealand's opponent.</p><p>Before the racing began, Cayard was not boastful.</p><p>''I think there are at least five of the competitors, if not all six, that can win any given day given a few breaks,'' Cayard said, ''and there are plenty of opportunities for breaks out here. The wind is real fickle and shifty. It's a tough racecourse, so you can't take anything for granted. It's not like if you have a little speed edge you are going to win for sure.</p><p>''For me, this is the riskiest part of the whole event,'' he said of the six-team semifinals. ''In light of the conditions, I would have much preferred a situation where we were racing with only four semifinalists and having a best-of-seven against just one guy.</p><p>''I think that would give the stronger teams more likelihood of prevailing. Here you could get caught out a couple of times, and that could make all the difference.''</p><p>Though the first three rounds were hardly lacking in drama, with boats sustaining serious damage in the sometimes punishing conditions in the Hauraki Gulf, they were low on rhetoric. That changed with Nippon's decision to practice with Team New Zealand.</p><p>America True was only the latest challenger to decline the invitation to spar with the Kiwis, but Gilmour, lobbied aggressively for the opportunity. His competitors, responded with some sharp words.</p><p>''I've been around 20 years, and I can tell you we didn't sail against the potential challengers in 1974 or in 1980, and we didn't sail against them in 1983 or 1995,'' said Conner, who has won the Cup three times as a skipper. ''It's surprising. You have to ask yourself what's in this for Peter. Maybe he doesn't think he's going to the America's Cup, and he wanted to get a picture of the Japanese boat sailing against Team New Zealand.''</p><p>Gilmour dismissed that suggestion and the criticism: ''New Zealand is a very competitive and great sporting team and should be respected as such. I'm sure we helped them. But I believe we helped ourselves more.''</p><p>Today was a day for Stars & Stripes to help itself, however, which it did with Conner, as usual, watching his hand-picked crew instead of sailing with them.</p></body></html>
