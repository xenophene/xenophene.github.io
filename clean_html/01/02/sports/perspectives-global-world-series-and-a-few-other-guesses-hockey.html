<p><strong></strong>Basketball players added muscles and multimillion-dollar sneaker contracts. American yachts lost the America's Cup, gained it back, then lost it again. Grass all but disappeared on tennis courts. The natural stuff almost became extinct in baseball and football before injuries and nostalgia spurred its comeback. Lights finally shone at Wrigley Field. Europe became a major talent pool for the National Hockey League; golf and tennis benefited from America's diversity. What could happen next, on and off the field? A look at nine sports.</p><p>The National Hockey League will establish a European division, and the Rangers, Devils and Islanders will play road games in Berlin, Helsinki and Moscow. Pay-per-view television, reasonably priced and accessible via the Internet, will substantially increase overall revenue. Teams will share it wisely and so will the players as the league grows to a healthy 40 franchises by 2025.</p><p>Because players will be so big and skilled, teams will play with either one fewer skater or on a bigger ice surface. In the next few decades, the league will see many European coaches, several African-American superstars and at least one female goalie. The Rangers will move to a bigger Madison Square Garden near the Hudson River. This building -- and others -- will lessen the frequency and volume of recorded rock music.
