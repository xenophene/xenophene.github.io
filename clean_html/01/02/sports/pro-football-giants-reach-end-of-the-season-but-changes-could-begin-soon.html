<p><strong></strong>Today brings the final game of the Giants' regular season, but there is little about this team that feels finished. Uncertainty clouds the team picture even as hope still pervades it.</p><p>For the Giants, today could bring an extraordinary confluence of events that sends them to the National Football League playoffs. Or, they could lose for the sixth time in their last eight games, a bewildering second-half collapse for a team that was in first place of its conference at the season's midpoint.</p><p>The Giants could conclude the season with a victory over Dallas today and finish 8-8, or they could be defeated and hand Giants Coach Jim Fassel his first losing season.</p><p>Not that Fassel would celebrate a second consecutive .500 season.</p><p>''Yeah, 8-8 is better than 7-9,'' he said last week. ''But I'm not happy with either one.''</p><p>The Giants could display the kind of character and mettle the team's co-owner Wellington Mara called for in his uncommon address to the players on Wednesday, and yet, even if they rout the Cowboys today, 15 or 20 current Giants might still be playing their last game with the franchise because there are 20 players on the roster who will become free agents.</p><p>It is a day that could be remembered as significant for the good things that happened to the Giants, or a day remembered, tellingly, as an example of the things that went wrong.</p><p>''I am watching everything very closely,'' Fassel said of today's game. ''It's true a lot of different scenarios can play out. Every one means something to me.''</p><p>The scenario the Giants long for the most is the one that is probably the least likely. How else to describe something that has not happened in 52 years?</p><p>The Giants' only valid chance to make the playoffs begins with an upset victory by the Arizona Cardinals in a 1 p.m. game at Green Bay. Arizona, a franchise that had its origin in Chicago, has not won in Green Bay since 1947.</p><p>But if these Cardinals, led by quarterback Jake Plummer, can add another inexplicable game result to a season of unexplainable outcomes, then the Giants need only defeat the Cowboys to earn the final National Football Conference wild card playoff berth.</p><p>Of course, the Cowboys have motivation, too, and it is not affected by the score of the Cardinals-Packers game. A Dallas victory over the Giants sends the Cowboys into the playoffs.</p><p>Since little about this day can be commonplace for the Giants, there is one other scenario that extends their season: If the Packers win, the Giants can still make the playoffs if they defeat Dallas by 56 more points than the Packers' margin of victory over Arizona.</p><p>Don't expect Fassel to be blitzing 10 men or throwing deep passes on every down in an attempt to score 75 points.</p><p>''I'll do whatever is reasonable to get us into the playoffs,'' Fassel said. ''But some of those things aren't reasonable. You wouldn't play a very good game. At that point in time, you just take your medicine.''</p><p>Which is not to say the Giants will not play hard. Fassel, and more importantly Mara, has demanded as much. And the coach said that regardless of the outcome in Green Bay, he would be playing all his regulars, including those who are injured, like running back Joe Montgomery, who has a rib injury, and tight end Pete Mitchell, who has a badly sprained ankle.</p><p>Fassel and the team's management will be making personnel evaluations today. Because the Giants have lost to Minnesota, St. Louis, Indianapolis and twice to Washington -- all teams headed to the playoffs -- the team leaders are becoming convinced they do not have enough championship-level players on the roster.</p><p>''When you get in the off-season,'' Fassel said last week, ''that's the way you measure whether you want to keep this guy or that guy. Is he going to help us win a championship? Not whether he'll help us be 8-8. That's not the goal. If he can't help us win a championship, then he doesn't have a place here.''</p><p>The Giants will face a number of off-season decisions on pivotal, noteworthy players. Among the unrestricted free agents is Phillippi Sparks, the team's starter at left cornerback since 1994. Sparks may want more money than the Giants are willing to give him, especially since he is likely to draw offers from other teams.</p><p>Sparks's backup, Conrad Hamilton, is also an unrestricted free agent, as is left tackle Roman Oben. So is nickel linebacker Scott Galyon, who may leave because he wants a chance to start elsewhere.</p><p>Galyon is a weakside linebacker, the position played by the Giants' three-time Pro Bowler Jessie Armstead.</p><p>The Giants also have 11 restricted free agents, players who other teams can bid on even if the Giants have the right to match any offer. But it might be hard to hold on to all 11.</p><p>Running back Tiki Barber and safety Sam Garnes are the biggest names on the restricted free-agent list. The Giants will find a way to keep Garnes, and they will probably use their leverage in the process to make it hard for other teams to lure Barber away.</p><p>Defensive tackle Christian Peter and linebackers Ryan Phillips and Pete Monty are also restricted free agents. There is a chance some team might take a shot at third-string quarterback Mike Cherry, who is also a restricted free agent as soon as the season ends.</p><p>And there are the more veteran players, who in the N.F.L. world of nonguaranteed contracts, could be cut loose. Defensive tackle Robert Harris, right tackle Scott Gragg and tight end Howard Cross could each face an unsettling off-season as the Giants sort out their needs and what they can afford under a tight salary cap.</p><p>Then there is free safety Percy Ellsworth, a popular player and the team's only real threat to intercept passes the last two seasons. Ellsworth, another unrestricted free agent, probably will not be pursued by the Giants this off-season because they made safety Shaun Williams their first-round pick in 1998 and are paying him accordingly. The Giants think that it is time for Williams to get on the field.</p><p>''I try not to think about it, but it's a reality,'' Ellsworth said, acknowledging that today could be his last game with the Giants. ''I'll just try to give them something good to remember me by.''</p><p>In many ways, today's game is trying to do the same thing for the disjointed 1999-2000 Giants season.</p></body></html>
