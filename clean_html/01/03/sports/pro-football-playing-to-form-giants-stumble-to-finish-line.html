<p><strong></strong>There was a certain air of hopelessness about the Giants from beginning to end today, despondency coupled with a dazed bewilderment, an aura of despair that pursues the team into the off-season.</p><p>The Dallas Cowboys' 26-18 victory at Texas Stadium was just the final act in a spiritless, daylong dissolution for the Giants. It began with the Green Bay Packers' defeat of the Arizona Cardinals in an early afternoon game, a result that all but mathematically eliminated the Giants from playoff contention.</p><p>True, the Giants knew as they took the field that they could still make the playoffs with an 81-point victory. Then they kicked off to start the game.</p><p>And Dallas returned the kick 79 yards to set up the game's first score. The Cowboys (8-8) scored often and early, sprinting to a 16-0 halftime lead and then cruising to a victory that earned them the final National Football Conference wild-card berth.</p><p>In a game that could have been a metaphor for their season, the Giants (7-9) started slowly, peaked at the midpoint, then stumbled badly to the finish. They also did not play with aggression, confidence or any of the mettle requested of them by the team co-owner Wellington Mara, who uncharacteristically addressed the club last week.</p><p>The Giants, who had once been a first-place team with a 5-3 record, closed their season with a 2-6 second half.</p><p>''We had lots of high hopes,'' safety Sam Garnes said. ''And then we went straight down the drain.''</p><p>It is the first losing season under Coach Jim Fassel, who did not scold or admonish his players in the locker room after the game.</p><p>''I think they gave it everything they had,'' he said. ''We weren't good enough. It hurts because we're used to winning at the end around here. But it characterizes the season.</p><p>''We're a shell of a team right now.''</p><p>Fassel and the Giants were aware of the Packers score as they began the game, though few admitted it had an effect on their play.</p><p>Free safety Percy Ellsworth, however, conceded the obvious.</p><p>''It's only human nature,'' he said. ''You're going to be a little down when you know you're out of it. Everybody tried, but yeah, there was disappointment.''</p><p>Several players acknowledged another obvious and likely outcome of today's game and a failed season -- that changes will be made in the team's makeup. The specifics of those changes were not discussed and several players said they thought the team had been forced to overcome a particularly onerous succession of injuries.</p><p>''I'm sure there will be some changes, but honestly, we've been a patchwork team for a long time,'' defensive end Michael Strahan said. ''We stood in there and fought. It's very frustrating because no one goes to training camp and does all that work to finish one game worse than last year's record.''</p><p>It took no more than a few seconds today to figure out which team had something to play for and which team did not. Dallas's Jason Tucker slipped the tackle attempt of Garnes just after taking the opening kickoff and then raced 79 yards to the Giants' 11-yard line.</p><p>Three rushing attempts by the Cowboys failed to get the ball into the end zone, but when Eddie Murray kicked a 20-yard field goal, the rout was on even if it was just 3-0 and just 2 minutes 18 seconds into the game.</p><p>On the Giants' first possession, the flat, disjointed attack that would typify their offensive effort for most of the game was obvious, and it was obvious that Fassel was not going to approach the game with a nothing-to-lose attitude.</p><p>In eight plays, the Giants moved to the Cowboys' 36-yard line, where they faced a fourth-and-5. Fassel did not elect to go for it.</p><p>On their next possession, the Cowboys had little trouble moving through the Giants again, though they again stalled near the Giants' goal line and settled for another Murray field goal.</p><p>The Giants' defense was without nearly half its starting lineup. Linebacker Jessie Armstead was on the sideline for long stretches of the first half resting his sore right knee and so was defensive tackle Christian Peter, who missed much of the first half with dizziness and a rapid heart beat, and defensive end Cedric Jones, who has a tender knee.</p><p>Two other starters from the beginning of the season were also out of the game: cornerbacks Jason Sehorn and Phillippi Sparks.</p><p>And the Giants' defense certainly was not getting a lift from the team's offense, which was moving the ball but barely threatening to score. Kerry Collins would throw for 314 yards, completing 31 of 48 passes, but did not have a touchdown pass until the game's final minute.</p><p>Joe Montgomery rushed for just 36 yards on 12 carries.</p><p>Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman, meanwhile, was picking apart the Giants' pass defense, which seemed not only a step slow but passive as well.</p><p>Consider the Cowboys' first touchdown, a 4-yard pass from Aikman to Raghib Ismail in the second quarter. Ismail, split to the right, ran a crossing route underneath the heart of the Giants' defense, passing a safety and two linebackers.</p><p>No one touched, nudged or tried to impede Ismail, who caught the pass as he stood at the goal line. Aikman completed 23 of 32 passes for 288 yards and 2 touchdowns. Dallas's Emmitt Smith ran for 122 yards on 22 attempts.</p><p>By halftime, the Cowboys had padded their lead to 16-0 with another Murray field goal.</p><p>The Giants hardly seemed intent on mounting a serious second-half threat. With their first possession, the Giants gained only 2 yards in three plays and gave the ball back to the Cowboys.</p><p>After a Giants field goal midway through the third quarter, Dallas put the game away for good when Aikman connected with Tucker on a quick slant pattern in front of cornerback Jeremy Lincoln.</p><p>Tucker caught the ball at the Cowboys' 17-yard line, spinning away from Lincoln, who made a poor one-armed effort at a tackle.</p><p>Tucker then raced up the left sideline for the 90-yard touchdown that sealed Dallas's victory.</p><p>''We weren't very mature today,'' Collins said. ''I don't know, maybe that's what we have to learn from all this.''</p></body></html>
