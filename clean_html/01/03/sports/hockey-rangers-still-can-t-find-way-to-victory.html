<p><strong></strong>If not for Mike Richter, the Rangers' first game of the new century would have ended like so many others here have concluded in the last century -- with a Canadiens victory.</p><p>The Canadiens came into the game with a 188-56-37 record in Montreal against the Rangers, who were 1-12-3 here in their last 16 regular-season matchups. These Canadiens hardly resemble their storied forebears. Still, Richter had to be brilliant in goal to preserve a 2-2 tie after Rangers defenseman Sylvain Lefebvre scored -- a rarity for him -- 10 minutes 10 seconds into the third period.</p><p>Lefebvre's second goal of the season, a slap shot from the top of the slot off a Jan Hlavac pass, gave the Rangers the tie. And the Rangers, who have now played overtime in 9 of their last 12 games, were able to fly home after a three-game trip with three of a possible six points in the standing.</p><p>''We were lucky to get a tie, because we weren't as good as we could have been,'' said Richter, who is nursing a sore groin. ''We weren't as good as we should have been.''</p><p>Richter was not speaking for himself. He stopped 28 shots, including 8 from point-blank range in the last half of the third period and 4 more in the 4-on-4 overtime as the Rangers gained a point in their fourth consecutive game. The tie extended the Rangers' stretch without a victory to six games (0-3-3 with a regulation tie). But the Rangers have scored points in four of those six games thanks to the new rules regarding overtime.</p><p>''We're getting a lot of practice at it,'' Rangers Coach John Muckler said, referring to the extra session the Rangers seem to be playing on a nightly basis. ''Maybe we'll get better at it.''</p><p>Theo Fleury said, ''Somewhere along the line here, we have to win a game.''</p><p>''Richter played well,'' Muckler said. ''Especially late in the game.''</p><p>The Rangers' first lineup of the new year had a new addition, and therefore a new look. Mike York's line, with Adam Graves and Fleury, remained intact, as did Petr Nedved's with Valery Kamensky and Hlavac.</p><p>Tim Taylor, however, skated with John MacLean and Mike Knuble, who had been a healthy scratch the last four games. Radek Dvorak, obtained Wednesday from Florida in a three-way deal that saw the popular Todd Harvey go to San Jose, made his Rangers debut centering a line for Eric Lacroix and the slumping Alexandre Daigle.</p><p>The Rangers controlled most of the first period. They took a 1-0 lead on a power play at 14:22, when York tallied his 11th goal of the season, which gave him the National Hockey League scoring lead for rookies.</p><p>The goal came on a tap-in off the left post after a Kevin Hatcher shot from the right circle had been blocked before it could reach Montreal goaltender Jeff Hackett.</p><p>But the game turned at 18:34 of the first, when the Rangers' Mathieu Schneider was whistled for holding the Canadiens' Aaron Asham. Before then, the Rangers held a 9-3 advantage in shots on goal. But Montreal's Benoit Brunet was credited with a power-play goal at 19:13 -- Eric Weinrich's shot from the left point appeared to go in off Rich Pilon's skate as he attempted to bulldoze Brunet from the slot -- and the score was tied at 1-1.</p><p>Then, with 11.3 seconds left in the first, Schneider took another penalty for high sticking Jason Ward, and 38 seconds into the second period Pilon was called for hooking Martin Rucinksy. All of a sudden, the Rangers had taken three penalties and were going to be skating for a minute and 12 seconds two men short.</p><p>They killed it, sort of. However, the second the penalty to Schneider ended, Sergei Zholtok skated in from the left circle and beat Richter, and the Canadiens had taken a 2-1 lead.</p><p>Lefebvre evened the score. Then -- after Richter pretty much forced the overtime by himself -- Lefebvre had a golden chance to win the game. But he could not get a good shot on a 2-on-1 rush with Schneider early in the extra session. And the Rangers had to settle for a single point. Again.</p><p>Not that Muckler wasn't going to take it. ''This may be a big point at the end of the season,'' he said. ''Somewhere down the line, somebody's probably going to miss the playoffs because they didn't get the two points. You need all the points you can get.''</p><p>SLAP SHOTS</p><p>To make room for RADEK DVORAK in the lineup, KEVIN STEVENS was a healthy scratch for the second time this season.</p></body></html>
