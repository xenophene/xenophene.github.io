<p><strong></strong>For a while this afternoon against the Giants, the Dallas Cowboys looked like the team that won three Super Bowls in four years during the 1990's.</p><p>Running back Emmitt Smith rushed for 122 yards. Quarterback Troy Aikman threw for 288 yards and 2 touchdowns. And a rookie receiver named Jason Tucker made like Michael Irvin and caught 4 passes for 122 yards, including a slant pass that he took 90 yards for a touchdown.</p><p>It was enough to give the Cowboys (8-8) a commanding 23-3 lead in the third quarter, paving the way for an eventual 26-18 victory over the hapless Giants (7-9).</p><p>''I don't want to get to foaming at the mouth too much over winning this game,'' Dallas's owner, Jerry Jones, said. ''We should beat the Giants. We should beat the Giants here at home with as much at stake as we got and the players we've got. We should beat them. We're going to play some games now that ought to be a flip of the coin as to whether we win those games as we go -- a legitimate contest.''</p><p>So, it's on to the playoffs for the Cowboys, who will play the Vikings in Minnesota next Sunday at 12:30 p.m. Jones now has visions of Super Bowls (present and future) dancing in his head.</p><p>''I genuinely feel we could do something special here and go to a Super Bowl,'' Jones said, following his team's victory. ''Anybody can take a look at our team and say that we can't win three football games. The odds are against us. But I think we have an opportunity.''</p><p>The Cowboys had been playing the last three weeks to get into the playoffs. First the Jets beat them, 22-21, and then last week they lost to New Orleans, 31-24. The Giants were their last and, if one follows Jones's way of thinking, best opportunity to get in to the postseason tournament. Before today's game started, the Giants had a Herculean task before them if they were to make the playoffs. They needed to beat Dallas by an 81-point margin. All Dallas had to do was win and they were in.</p><p>As the Giants' owner Wellington Mara did on Wednesday, Jones had spoken to some of his players and expressed to them the importance of winning today.</p><p>The Giants fell flat on their faces. The Cowboys, on the strength of some superior play from their standout offensive skill players, rose to the occasion.</p><p>Aikman said the speech had no impact on his performance.</p><p>''We're paid professionals,'' he said. ''If it takes somebody standing up and saying that everybody is accountable for themselves, then we've got the wrong guys on our football team.''</p><p>Jones's speech, though, did get the attention of Dallas tackle Erik Williams.</p><p>''I don't think I needed any extra incentive, but it was coming from the head man,'' Williams said. ''It's like E. F. Hutton. When he speaks, you listen.''</p><p>Aikman attached no great significance to the way his team played today. But it was obvious that he has grown comfortable with his young receivers like Tucker, who had dropped a touchdown pass in the second quarter.</p><p>''It says something about Troy to believe that a guy is going to be where he's supposed to be,'' Dallas Coach Chan Gailey said. ''Troy threw some passes to him today before he came out of the break.''</p><p>The Cowboys exploded out of the blocks. Tucker returned the opening kickoff 79 yards, and a personal foul against Giants receiver David Patten for yanking Tucker's face mask on the tackle gave the Cowboys a first-and-goal at the New York 5. The Cowboys could not punch the ball in and had to settle for a field goal. It was the beginning of their woes inside the red zone.</p><p>But it didn't matter much this afternoon, because the Giants were not inclined to score any points in the first half and Dallas took a 16-0 lead to the locker room.</p><p>When Tucker caught that slant pass in the third quarter and broke free from Giants cornerback Jeremy Lincoln and went 90 yards for a touchdown, the Cowboys were in control.</p><p>Aikman, thinking back to days in the past, said it would be nice to roll up over 400 yards of offense each game. But he will take a performance like today, because they have been rare in this up-and-down season.</p><p>''The team has been through a lot this year,'' he said. ''The team has regrouped when it has absolutely had to. Right now we have as good a shot in the playoffs as we had a year ago. All that matters right now is how you play once you get in the playoffs.''</p></body></html>
