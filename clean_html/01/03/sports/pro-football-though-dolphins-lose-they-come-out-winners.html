<p><strong></strong>Many Miami Dolphins players and coaches spent early this afternoon staring at the television while sprawled about a stadium lounge in the bowels of Fed Ex Field, and they were not watching cartoons. Miami needed help from other teams in other games to get into the playoffs, and their coming contest against Washington was basically irrelevant to those postseason dreams. So it was understandable that Coach Jimmy Johnson was snuggled up to the set as if he were watching home videos.</p><p>Miami needed for either Seattle to lose to the Jets or for Kansas City to lose to Oakland in early games to get in. Both things happened, and the Dolphins knew they were in the playoffs before taking the field against Washington.</p><p>Miami (9-7) will play at Seattle, giving Johnson his third straight trip to the playoffs as coach of the Dolphins. The Redskins (10-6) have a home game against Detroit on Sunday.</p><p>But as Miami's 21-10 loss to the Redskins before 78,106 showed, the Dolphins are a team with numerous problems. They make mental errors, like the two first-quarter turnovers in Washington territory. Quarterback Dan Marino's arm is not what it used to be. Footballs leave his hand with all the velocity of a Wiffle Ball leaving a plastic bat. And questions about the futures of Marino and Johnson are discussed daily by the news media, causing both men, as well as players, giant ulcers.</p><p>The Dolphins have long been a stable organization and have rarely faced such possible upheaval. Johnson, its football guru, may permanently depart, go sailing and disappear, and Marino, the franchise thrower who has a reservation in the Hall of Fame, may retire after the season.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Dolphins have crawled into the playoffs. After starting the year 7-1, Miami lost six of its last eight games. Now the team must travel to Seattle, where its playoff fortunes seem equally dim. Miami's last road playoff victory was 1972.</p><p>''Of course everybody talks about us backing into the playoffs,'' Johnson said. ''It's a simple deal. If you win enough games, you get in. We won enough games.''</p><p>The Redskins played this game perfectly, giving plenty of effort, toning the offense and then pulling key starters early in the third quarter, including Brad Johnson, who went 7 of 11 passing for 75 yards. With running back Stephen Davis nursing an injured knee, the backup Skip Hicks got the call and often plowed through the Dolphins. Washington took a 7-0 lead in the second quarter following his 8-yard touchdown run.</p><p>Miami played horribly on offense. The Dolphins managed only a 39-yard field goal by Olindo Mare in the first half. Twice they were able to get drives going, only to stop themselves. The first turnover came when wide receiver Kevin McKenzie was stripped of the football inside the Washington 30-yard line by safety Darryl Pounds, who also recovered the ball. The second happened when a Marino pass was tipped in the secondary by cornerback Tim Denton, and the 5-foot-7-inch cornerback Mark McMillian outjumped everyone and plucked the wobbly ball out of the sky. Marino finished 11 for 24 passing for 118 yards.</p><p>The Redskins added a 30-yard touchdown pass from the backup Rodney Peete to wide receiver Irving Fryar and led by 14-3 at the beginning of the fourth quarter. By then, Johnson had pulled Marino for Damon Huard, who finished 18 for 29 passing for 162 yards.</p><p>The game itself was not the most intriguing part of the day. The Dolphins have more story lines than a busy night in the theater district. The most compelling is what may happen to Johnson, Marino or both.</p><p>The Dolphins' owner, H. Wayne Huizenga, flew Marino's family to the game, which is unusual. The speculation was that the family wanted to be present just in case this was Marino's final game. Marino, however, said that the trip was ''planned awhile back'' and that there was no special significance.</p><p>When asked if he thought that this might be his last regular-season game, Marino replied: ''I've been asked that question and I'm tired of answering it. You never know when your last game is going to be. Who knows what your future is going to hold?''</p><p>The same could be said for the Redskins. Unless the team advances far into the playoffs, the owner, Daniel Snyder, will most likely ask Coach Norv Turner to dismiss some members from his defensive staff. Washington has spent much of the season ranked near the bottom in almost every defensive category.</p><p>But right now the Redskins are not thinking about that. They're in. That's all that matters, for now.</p><p>Offensive tackle Jon Jansen was asked if the Redskins could reach the Super Bowl. ''Sure, why not?'' he said. ''It's going to be somebody, why not us?''</p></body></html>
