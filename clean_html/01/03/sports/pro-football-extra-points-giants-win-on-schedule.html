<p><strong></strong>The Giants' 26-18 loss to the Dallas Cowboys gives them their first losing season since 1996, but it will make their 2000 schedule easier. Besides their eight games against division opponents, the Giants will have home games against Detroit, St. Louis, Jacksonville and Pittsburgh. Their away games will be against Chicago, Tennessee, Cleveland and the winner of tonight's game between San Francisco and Atlanta.</p><p>Fassel's Future</p><p>There was little talk in the Giants' locker room of Coach Jim Fassel. It was considered a foregone conclusion that he would back next season.</p><p>''Am I on his side?'' defensive end Michael Strahan said. ''Yeah, I am. Do I want him back? Yeah, I do.''</p><p>Incidentally, Fassel not only did not try to outscore the Cowboys by 81 points -- which would have qualified the Giants for the playoffs -- but the Giants' offense also seemed to operate conservatively. Most pass plays were underneath and screen passes. In the first half, the Giants had just 60 yards, only 14 on the ground.</p><p>''It's really unrealistic,'' Fassel said of trying to score 81 more points than Dallas. ''We couldn't score enough points. So we stuck with our general game plan and played our game.''</p><p>Finally, Replay Reward</p><p>The Giants went for a 2-point conversion after Kerry Collins threw a 7-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Brian Alford in the game's final minute. Joe Montgomery seemed to nudge the ball into the end zone on a running play. At first, the conversion attempt was ruled good, then the call was reversed.</p><p>Using the video replay system, the call was overturned and the Giants got their 2 points. So, in the final minute of a 7-9 season, they finally had a successful replay reversal.</p><p>Toomer Catches Record</p><p>Amani Toomer's two receptions give him 79 for the season, which is a team record, eclipsing Earnest Gray's 78 in 1983.</p><p>Running back Sean Bennett, who had an injury-plagued season, had a couple of strong runs, including a 29-yarder in the fourth quarter.
