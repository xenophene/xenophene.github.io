<p><strong></strong>In a game that had the same winner and the same loser as the 1998 Orange Bowl, if not the same national championship implications, Nebraska overpowered and wore down Tennessee in the second half tonight for a 31-21 victory in the Fiesta Bowl.</p><p>After letting a 17-0 lead shrink to 3 points, the No. 3-ranked Cornhuskers (12-1) pounded out scoring drives of 96 and 99 yards in the second half and finished the game with 23 consecutive running plays. Nebraska totaled 321 yards on the ground, led by 108 from Dan Alexander, who scored Nebraska's first touchdown. Fullback Willie Miller added 87 yards, quarterback Eric Crouch 64 yards and Correll Buckhalter 59 yards.</p><p>Crouch also completed 9 of 15 passes for 148 yards, including a 13-yard touchdown pass to tight end Aaron Golliday, and was named the game's most valuable player.</p><p>''We finally decided to get our power game going,'' Crouch said. ''With our offensive line, we knew we could keep the momentum going.''</p><p>Despite gaining only 44 yards on the ground, the No. 6-ranked Volunteers (9-3) put up a determined fight. They scored midway through the fourth quarter on a 44-yard gimmick pass play to Donte Stallworth from receiver Cedrick Wilson, who drew the attention of the Nebraska defense by catching a long lateral from quarterback Tee Martin. But Nebraska recovered an onside kick and marched downfield to run out the final 7 minutes 25 seconds.</p><p>''It's hard to spot a good team like that 14 points,'' Tennessee's Coach Phillip Fulmer said. ''When a team goes 99 and 96 yards on you, that's something special. We got another good lesson tonight. But I'm proud of my kids. They fought to the end.''</p><p>The game amounted to the national title consolation game between teams that fell just short of reaching Tuesday night's Sugar Bowl, which will feature two unbeaten teams in Florida State and Virginia Tech. The Fiesta Bowl also was a rematch of Nebraska's 42-17 Orange Bowl victory two years ago, which earned the Cornhuskers a share of the national title.</p><p>''We wore them down a little bit,'' Nebraska Coach Frank Solich said of Tennessee, which lost six players to injury. ''We're convinced we have as good a team as anybody. But we go with the system. We know how it works, and there are two undefeated teams playing for the title.''</p><p>This was virtually a home game for Big 12 champion Nebraska, whose fans filled three-fourths of Sun Devil Stadium, the site of Tennessee's national championship victory last year over Florida State.</p><p>Field position was the key in the first half, and Nebraska set the tone with the coin flip. The Cornhuskers won the toss and elected to kick off, and the strategy worked immediately. Tennessee went three plays and out, and Bobby Newcombe returned the ensuing punt 12 yards, setting up Nebraska at the Tennessee 43-yard line.</p><p>The Cornhuskers needed only four plays to take the lead. Crouch's 30-yard run on a third-and-4 option keeper was followed by Alexander's 7-yard touchdown run around left end with the game only 3:26 old.</p><p>Tennessee tried to respond despite a running game that netted only 25 yards on 18 carries in the first half, advancing to the Nebraska 17 on the next possession before stalling and coming away empty when Alex Walls's 45-yard field-goal attempt sailed wide left.</p><p>Nebraska's Dan Hadenfeld pinned Tennessee at its 5-yard line on his next punt, and when the Volunteers' drive stalled, Newcombe dropped back to field David Leaverton's punt. Sixty yards later, Newcombe had a touchdown return and Nebraska had a 14-0 first-quarter lead.</p><p>Trying to get his club back into the game, Martin was picked off on consecutive pass attempts in the second quarter, first by Joe Walker on a tipped pass and then on a difficult leaping grab by Mike Brown, who wrestled away a deep throw by outjumping Stallworth.</p><p>The Cornhuskers' kicking game got lucky when Josh Brown's 31-yard field goal banked off the right upright and through the goalposts to give Nebraska a 17-0 lead. But the ensuing kickoff went out of bounds, allowing Tennessee to start from its 35 with 1:37 left in the half.</p><p>Martin completed his next six passes, not counting a spike to stop the clock, and capped the drive with 18 seconds left on a crisp 9-yard slant touchdown pass to Stallworth.</p><p>The defense helped Tennessee on the first play of the third quarter when Alexander, breaking tackles, was stripped of the ball by Will Overstreet. Dominique Stevenson recovered at the Nebraska 25 and Travis Henry cashed in with a 4-yard touchdown run as the Volunteers cut Nebraska's lead to 17-14.</p><p>But the Cornhuskers did not abandon Alexander, who carried on the first four plays of a nine-play, 96-yard drive that ended with a 13-yard touchdown pass from Crouch to Golliday. The key play in the drive was a 47-yard run up the middle by Miller, a junior blocking back whose previous career-long run was 19 yards.</p></body></html>
