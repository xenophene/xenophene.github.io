<p><strong></strong>When the doors to the Seattle Seahawks' locker room opened after today's game, running back Ricky Watters stormed through, carrying his luggage toward the team bus with his head down, muttering, ''I'm not waiting to see if they can win a game.'' His team had not been able to do that, and he was not interested in navigating the National Football League's maze of playoff possibilities.</p><p>Around the room, other players dressed slowly, speaking quietly about lost opportunities. The Seahawks had come to Giants Stadium needing a victory over the Jets to assure themselves of a playoff berth. Now, after walking off the field with a disappointing 19-9 loss, they had a hard time considering the possibility that they could still back into the postseason.</p><p>A victory by the Oakland Raiders over the Kansas City Chiefs, in a game that was still going on as the Seahawks mulled their fate, would give Seattle the West Division championship and a berth in the playoffs. Quarterback Jon Kitna stood in the interview room trying to explain away the disappointment of his team's performance, while some of the team's coaches and players crowded into a small room separated by a pair of metal doors to watch the Raiders and Chiefs.</p><p>Suddenly, a loud burst of applause echoed through the doors and Kitna changed his tone without missing a beat.</p><p>He said with a smile: ''It sounds like we're going to be in. As I was saying, the new season just starts and it's a 12-team tournament and let's go for it. The thing about it is, if we get in, we did whatever we had to do. We didn't do it on our own, but the reality is, over a 16-game season we were one of 12 teams to get in.''</p><p>The mood in the Seattle locker room whipped from despair to jubilation as word spread of the Raiders' 41-38 overtime victory. The Seahawks forgot their miseries of an hour earlier. When they had limped into the locker room after the loss, Coach Mike Holmgren had gathered his team and plotted his end-of-season speech.</p><p>While the Seahawks were stumbling through their game, Holmgren said, he did not glance at the scoreboard to notice the back-and-forth action taking place in Kansas City. He was unaware that the Raiders were not giving up, trailing by 3 points with six minutes to play as the Seahawks (9-7) left the field.</p><p>''I addressed the team, talked to the team about checkout procedures tomorrow and all that kind of stuff,'' Holmgren said. ''Then one of the players, after I was rather lengthy and we had a team prayer, I started to go in the locker room, he said, 'Mike, do we know what happened in the other game?' I said, 'Gee, no.'</p><p>''It was on in the coaches' room, so we went in there, a bunch of guys started watching it. I watched it to the tie, and said, 'This is too much,' went in and took my cold shower.''</p><p>In the moments before the Raiders' victory, most of the players did not watch, either heading for the bus or sitting by their lockers trying to come to terms with their own failure.</p><p>''This stinks right now,'' linebacker Chad Brown said at the time. ''This is our playoff game, and for us not to get it done, it's sad.''</p><p>Like his coach, Brown had little use for the scoreboard. ''Late in the fourth quarter, I looked up at the board and saw it and said, 'Wow, that's the first time I've looked at the board all day,' '' he said. ''I didn't even look at the score. When it's in your control, why worry about anyone else?''</p><p>Then Brown, after getting word of the turn of fate, said: ''Some things need to be fixed. But once you're in the dance, you have a chance to go as far as you can. Why would you feel bad about being in the playoffs? There are only so many teams playing next week, and we're going to be one of them. I feel good about it.''</p><p>Nearly an hour after his game was over, Holmgren said: ''You go from the depths of despair to euphoria.</p><p>''Sure, I was disappointed in how we played today, and we were capable of better. You play 16 hard games, and in the end somebody has to be Western Division champions. We're Western Division champions. It's really something. I'd like to have gone kicking through the door. We didn't do that, but I'll take it.''</p></body></html>
