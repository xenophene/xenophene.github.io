<p><strong></strong>In the isolation of his suspension, Kurt Thomas spent one game in his living room and the other in a Washington hotel room, in bed with tissues and fluids by his side as part of a flu survival kit.</p><p>''It felt strange being away,'' Thomas said today. ''I've been sick, too. So maybe the timing was good.''</p><p>Now, he emerges from his two-game exile healthy and ready to make the Knicks whole again. But he will make that return on Tuesday night against Boston with a tainted image after he threw elbows to the head of Indiana's Jalen Rose on Christmas Day and then verbally lashed out at Rose and Reggie Miller two days later.</p><p>Today, a much calmer and more composed Thomas restrained himself from saying anything else inflammatory but defended himself from the thug perceptions that have been formed about him.</p><p>''I know I'm not a thug,'' he said. ''I don't have any type of criminal record, never been in any trouble and never will be. I don't concern myself with what other people think. I do my job and go home.''</p><p>Part of his job is to be an aggressor on the court. But as Thomas said, Coach Jeff Van Gundy wants him to be able to turn the other cheek next time. ''He just said I mean a lot to the team,'' Thomas said, referring to his recent meeting with Van Gundy. ''He said I can't let an incident like that happen.''</p><p>Time to start over. The Knicks have all of their working parts now and have an opportunity to take advantage of a favorable schedule that has them playing 11 of their next 19 games at home.</p><p>''As I was saying to the guys, at 18-12, the record is O.K.,'' said Van Gundy, whose team has the fourth-best record in the East and is tied for the 10th best in the league with Seattle. ''But the direction our team is going, we're not headed where we need to head.''</p><p>The Knicks have been sliding toward some danger zones. In the first five games, the Knicks averaged 24 assists. In the last five, they are down to 16. Particularly over the last dozen games, they have had problems in holding leads and in making critical free throws, in hustling to loose balls and in defending the 3-point line.</p><p>For a team that seems bored with the regular season and is noticeably low on energy many nights, there is no more pressing issue than rebounding. It is a statistic driven by active, athletic, live bodies. Throughout the season, the Knicks have been stuck in the bottom third of the league in rebounding and are currently ranked 21st.</p><p>Van Gundy has tried everything. He has used big lineups and small lineups and has shuffled his personnel like a dealer on the Las Vegas strip. So far, same results. Most often, it all comes back to how the Knicks fail to defend off the dribble. Once a point guard or shooting guard gets by a Knicks defender and slips into the paint, help has to arrive, rotations occur, bodies are out of place and a rebound opportunity gets lost.</p><p>''The biggest problem -- one of the reasons we give up second shots -- we get crushed off the dribble,'' Van Gundy said. ''With the new rules, we're having a hard time adjusting to keeping the dribble in front of us.''</p><p>Usually, the Knicks' point guards are tagged for the problem. Stephon Marbury and Kenny Anderson are among the point guards who have revealed how vulnerable Charlie Ward and Chris Childs are to getting beat off the dribble. But Allan Houston has had trouble containing his man, as well.</p><p>''It's a team-wide problem,'' Van Gundy said. ''Sometimes, we're just not as active to the ball as we need to be. We have to be less reliant on help defense. If you can't rebound, it's hard to be a successful team.''</p><p>The Knicks were dreadful against the Wizards on Thursday night and were fortunate to win after being outrebounded, 47-30. Thomas, the team's third-best rebounder, watched it all unfold from afar. With time to mull over the way he plays, Thomas said he was not changing his aggressive nature but would resist the temptation to lash out at his opponents.</p><p>''I'm just going to play my game,'' he said. ''If people view me as an enforcer, that's how they view me. If they view me as a finesse man, that's how they view me. I just play hard on both ends of the floor. I just view myself as a player who plays hard.''</p><p>The Knicks are glad to take him back and start the new year with all their players available, and are ready to correct the problems that have haunted them in the first third of the season.</p><p>REBOUNDS</p><p>CHRIS CHILDS's wife gave birth to one of the first babies of the new year.
