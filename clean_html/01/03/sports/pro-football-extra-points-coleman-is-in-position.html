<p><strong></strong>Marcus Coleman began the season as a third-string cornerback, became an impact player as the season wound down and is now negotiating the most lucrative contract ever given a Jets defensive back.</p><p>The right cornerback had another interception yesterday, giving him a team-leading six on the season. He was second in the game behind Victor Green in tackles with six.</p><p>''I'm going to wait until the playoffs are over,'' he said about his free-agency status. The Jets are believed to have offered him a three-year deal worth about $4 million annually.</p><p>It's Up, It's Good (Naturally)</p><p>John Hall's four field goals provided more than the winning margin against Seattle -- they capped a season in which he reached the goal of being an 80 percent kicker. He also was perfect between the 30 and 39 yards, converting all 17 attempts from that distance, including his three yesterday. For the season, he made 27 of 33 kicks (82 percent).</p><p>Although Tom Tupa produced an average of almost 50 yards on his three punts yesterday, he fell short of establishing a Jets' single-season mark for punters. He wound up with a 45.2-yard average; Curley Johnson averaged 45.3 yards in 1965.</p><p>But Curtis Martin yesterday surpassed Freeman McNeil's club rushing record for a season (1,331 yards in 1985). Martin had his biggest game as a Jet, 158 yards, including a season-best 50 on one carry. He finished with 1,464 yards.</p><p>Meanwhile, Keyshawn Johnson was held to 3 receptions and finished with 89, the second-highest season total in club history. The record of 93 remains with Al Toon, who set it in 1988.</p><p>Ray Lucas, who came into the game trailing only the Colts' Peyton Manning for the highest American Conference passer rating, lost his chance to finish on top by tossing a pair of interceptions.</p><p>2000 Schedule Emerges</p><p>The Jets tied the Patriots at 8-8, but wind up in fourth place ahead of them in the American Conference East. The Jets had a better division mark. Thus, next season's schedule looks like this: Home -- Denver, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Detroit, New England, Buffalo, Indianapolis and Miami. Away -- Oakland, Baltimore, Green Bay, Tampa Bay, New England, Buffalo, Indianapolis and Miami. GERALD ESKENAZI</p></body></html>
