<p><strong></strong>The Nets are inching away from predictions last week that center Jayson Williams would begin practicing between Wednesday and Friday, and Coach Don Casey said he would not be surprised if Williams did not play at all this season.</p><p>Casey said today that he had made no plans to incorporate Williams, who broke his right leg last April 1, into the team's workouts.</p><p>''He still has to see the doctors before he sees us,'' Casey said. ''There's nothing set in my mind. He might be out the year. I think Jayson has to be prepared, and we're prepared that he might be out the whole year.''</p></body></html>
