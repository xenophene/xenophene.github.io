<p><strong></strong>Mike Holmgren walked toward the middle of Giants Stadium yesterday after his team had been tripped, 19-9, by the Jets, mumbled something to the Jets coaches, and walked away, unsure where his final steps would lead. He made his way to the locker room, to his players, and told them they were lousy in execution but great in effort.</p><p>Then Holmgren did what plenty of football fans did yesterday afternoon -- he plopped in front of a TV and sorted through the menu of games that would decide which teams were in the playoffs.</p><p>Holmgren's particular fare was Oakland at Kansas City.</p><p>Seattle, with a chance to clinch a playoff berth, had just bombed. But now Kansas City was slipping, too. For Seattle, there was hope.</p><p>Holmgren finally emerged and conducted his postgame press conference. He talked about his team ''maybe wanting the game too much,'' and ''this was a big game today and only a few guys in that locker room have ever played in a game like this,'' and how against the Jets his Seahawks ''couldn't make the big play,'' and ''we're young in some places,'' and ''we're going to evaluate everything, the whole program, because we were too inconsistent,'' and that he ''was proud of his team,'' and that it had ''taken a good step.''</p><p>It sure sounded like a season-ending, see-you-later, swan song.</p><p>Then, he bolted back to watch the Kansas City game. It was tense, and Holmgren, who said he could only watch so much, went and took a shower.</p><p>Later he was told that the Raiders were gaining momentum. And soon they won, 41-38, in overtime against Kansas City.</p><p>A hearty roar erupted from the Seattle closed-door coaches' room, matching anything the more than 60,000 fans in Giants Stadium had offered all day.</p><p>Soon, the door swung open and Holmgren, his face flushed red as a stop light, appeared. Time for a post-postgame news conference.</p><p>Seattle was in.</p><p>Any sense of embarrassment, remarkably, was out.</p><p>The Seattle-Kansas City tango for first place in the American Football Conference West illustrated the frustration and high-strung play that was often featured this season. A bushel of sometimes laughable teams absolutely folded under the enormous weight and pressure of making the playoffs.</p><p>Especially in the final weeks of the regular season, several teams that controlled their playoff destiny collapsed. Pressure? Choke? Holes exposed? Parity?</p><p>All are factors, but regardless, the playoff field is set, with the Jacksonville Jaguars earning home-field advantage throughout the A.F.C. playoffs and the St. Louis Rams owning that treat in the N.F.C.</p><p>There are plenty of stressed-out teams in the playoff field.</p><p>The Detroit Lions enter the postseason having lost their last four games, including yesterday's, by 24-17 to the Minnesota Vikings. Detroit takes that extra burden with it to play in Washington. The Miami Dolphins have limped in. Dallas could not beat horrible New Orleans a week earlier, but finally reached the postseason by taming the Giants on Sunday.</p><p>Only two N.F.C. teams -- St. Louis and Tampa Bay -- have 11 or more victories.</p><p>Seattle began the season with an 8-2 record; it could win only one of its last six games, yet it is playoff bound. It lost to the Jets today and, simultaneously, stunningly, won a division title, a playoff berth and a home wild-card playoff game in one swoop.</p><p>''You go out and play these games and you forget sometimes that nobody is guaranteed to win,'' Seattle linebacker Darrin Smith said. ''You might even be the better team, but it doesn't matter how good you are if you don't play your best ball. This is what happened to us. You look at teams like the Jets and Denver, they were Super Bowl favorites but fell on hard times early. But in the last few weeks, those teams have ironed out their problems and are playing good ball.</p><p>''There is a very fine line between all of these teams, and that makes it a fine line between getting in and being out.''</p><p>Some of what determines the playoff field is heart and will. Some of it is luck.</p><p>''Heck no,'' Holmgren responded when someone asked him, before Seattle was in, if he would feel embarrassed entering the field through the back door. ''That would be wonderful. We'll take it.''</p><p>Later, once his his team had qualified, he added: ''At first I felt really sad for our guys. But now we have a second chance to show that we are a better football team than we've been lately. And I am really proud of that. I believe we will show it.''</p><p>For many of the 12 playoff teams, a second and third and even fourth chance was required to get in. But what a difference between being in and being out.</p><p>The playoffs provide a new game, a new season. Each entrant might as well be 0-0 after this far-flung, circuitous chase.</p><p>''There's beauty in that, isn't there?'' Seattle linebacker Chad Brown said.</p><p>Yeah, comedy, too.</p></body></html>
