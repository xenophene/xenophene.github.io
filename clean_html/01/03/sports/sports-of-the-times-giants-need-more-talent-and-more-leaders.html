<p><strong></strong>JERRY JONES, the Dallas Cowboys' owner, put his team's 26-18 victory yesterday in perspective and inadvertently put the Giants in perspective as well.</p><p>''I don't want to get too foaming at the mouth over winning this game,'' he said. ''We should beat the Giants here at home with as much at stake as we got and the players we've got. We should beat them.''</p><p>And beat them the Cowboys did.</p><p>But this was not a stunning loss by the Giants. In fact, these last three weeks may have been disappointing but should not have been surprising.</p><p>Linebacker Jessie Armstead was asked to think back to Dec. 12, when the Giants stunned Buffalo on a last-second field goal. Did he think then, when the team was 7-6, that its season would be over three weeks later? Certainly not.</p><p>''We just didn't grab the moment,'' he said yesterday. ''This has been a down year in the conference. Now it's a down year for us.''</p><p>That miraculous moment in Buffalo was the high-water point for these Giants. After that they were in over their heads, in competition and expectations. The Giants lost to St. Louis, 31-10, and Minnesota, 34-17, and yesterday they were down by 26-10 before finishing with a heroic rush.</p><p>Don't be misled: the Giants aren't that good.</p><p>As Jones said, a team like the Cowboys, with an infrastructure of leadership in Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith and Deion Sanders, is supposed to beat a team like the Giants with islands of talent and muzzled leadership.</p><p>This week Giants Coach Jim Fassel is going to talk to his players and issue evaluations. When he gets to Armstead and defensive end Michael Strahan, he may want to ask them to take an active role in determining the type of players the Giants need. The National Football League is becoming more explosive, filled with exciting, big-play players, like Jason Tucker, who broke the Giants' back yesterday with a 90-yard touchdown catch and run. Even Smith, the Cowboys' 30-year-old running back, has bursts.</p><p>Since being criticized by Fassel for criticisms of his team's play, Armstead has pulled back and the team has lost some fire. That leadership is the difference between the Giants and the Cowboys.</p><p>''They have leaders,'' Armstead said. ''They know what it takes to win. They might have a bad play, they might even have a bad game, but they keep coming.''</p><p>But the Giants, who finished 7-9, need more leadership and more talent, and Armstead knows it. Dallas made plays yesterday, Minnesota made big plays, St. Louis made big plays.</p><p>''This is a disappointing way to finish the season,'' Fassel said. ''The guys gave a good effort. I thought they tried. We just weren't good. In the past weeks we've played playoff teams and we weren't good enough.''</p><p>You knew this was going to happen; knew it. The Giants were reeling, clinging to the dream of a playoff berth for about 15 minutes. Somewhere between the national anthem and the opening kickoff, their playoff hopes were squashed as Green Bay finished routing Arizona.</p><p>''That didn't have anything to do with losing,'' Fassel said. ''They didn't go through the motions today. We just weren't good enough.''</p><p>Armstead dressed quickly yesterday and then sat in front of his dressing stall and tried to put five months of disappointment into neat sound bites. He couldn't. That's not Armstead's nature. The closing loss, in a game that wasn't quite as close as the 8-point margin of defeat indicated, ''leaves a bad taste in your mouth,'' he said.</p><p>This was a last day of contingencies in a season of contingencies, when everyone in the league seemed to need someone else to secure a playoff berth. The Giants' playoff hopes included the slim chance that anemic Arizona would march into Lambeau Field and defeat the Packers. The Giants needed Arizona to negate the effect of the Giants' two shocking losses to the Cardinals: by 14-3 on Oct. 10 and by 34-24 on Nov. 28. There was the Giants' infamous game in Washington on Nov. 21 when key players, Armstead in particular, complained about the offense's lack of production.</p><p>Once Green Bay won, the Giants had to defeat Dallas by 56 points more than the Packers' margin of victory, so that required an 81-point victory.</p><p>Other teams were in a similar position. There was a burlesque quality to the N.F.L.'s final day, a points orgy as teams were forced into gratuitous scoring against punching-dummy teams to secure home-field advantage or a playoff berth. Some teams were playing not just the opponent on the field but also a multidimensional competition in which they faced the opponent at hand and one hundreds of miles away.</p><p>Dallas, the team at hand for the Giants, was too much. Now the Giants join the other also-rans on the sideline. They will reflect and reassess. The team's hierarchy, if it's wise, will take the muzzle off players like Armstead and seek their opinions.</p><p>''If they ask me, I'll answer,'' he said.</p><p>The Giants had better ask. Big Blue needs a fresh view of itself.</p></body></html>
