<p><strong></strong>In an effort to squeeze the last drop of optimism out of their previous homestand, the Islanders harped on the positives of their 4-1 loss today to the Philadelphia Flyers.</p><p>The Islanders said they were competitive in five-on-five situations. They said they played hard.</p><p>But the words carried an echo as distant as the stretch in which the Islanders posted a 3-2-1 record while playing their best hockey of the season. That was three losses ago.</p><p>The Islanders, playing before 14,228 at Nassau Coliseum, showed that their penalty-killing unit is ranked No. 25 in the National Hockey League for good reason.</p><p>After surrendering five power-play goals in a 9-3 loss to Pittsburgh on Thursday night, the Islanders gave up two power-play goals -- by Rod Brind'Amour and John LeClair, in the first period to fall behind, 2-1. Then the Flyers exploited a tentative Islanders defense for even-strength goals by LeClair in the second period and Eric Lindros in the third.</p><p>''We can't kill penalties, and it sometimes gets you to step back and you don't play as hard as you should because you're scared to take a penalty,'' Islanders Coach Butch Goring said. ''We just have struggled in the special teams area, and that's probably the reason we are where we are today in the standings.''</p><p>That is last in the Atlantic Division with a 9-22-5 record and 23 points, which ties them with the expansion Atlanta Thrashers for last in the Eastern Conference standing. Philadelphia, stretching its unbeaten string to four games, improved to 22-11-6-1 (51 points), just 1 point behind Eastern Conference-leading Toronto.</p><p>With the Islanders trailing by 2-1, Mariusz Czerkawski and Jorgen Jonsson whizzed shots past Flyers goalie Brian Boucher, but the puck hit the crossbar both times.</p><p>''If I wanted to hit the crossbar I probably couldn't do it,'' Czerkawski said, ''but unfortunately I did.''</p><p>Lindros said: ''If that goes in, anything can happen. It wasn't your typical 4-1 game.''</p><p>The Islanders' 6-0-2 record in their last eight games at home against the Flyers had kept the embers of a rivalry alive. But the difference in the teams' ability and the departure of Lindros's nemesis, Rich Pilon, to the Rangers last month has threatened to smother the rivalry.</p><p>Today, the Flyers nearly zapped the emotion from the game before fans had settled in their seats. Seconds after Islanders defenseman Eric Brewer was penalized for hooking, Brind'Amour worked his way behind the 6-foot-9-inch defenseman Zdeno Chara and flicked in a pass from Eric Desjardins.</p><p>The Islanders tied the score at 1-1 six minutes later when Mats Lindgren fired a shot from the left circle past Boucher's right shoulder.</p><p>Philadelphia capitalized on another man advantage late in the first period.</p><p>Five seconds after an interference call against the Islanders' Niklas Andersson, Desjardins tapped the puck to LeClair, who was stationed in front of goalie Kevin Weekes. LeClair redirected the puck into the net.</p></body></html>
