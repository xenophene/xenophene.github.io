<p><strong></strong>CURTIS MARTIN had spent the afternoon slashing through boxcar-size holes or gliding acrobatically around tacklers.</p><p>This time he met the subject head-on.</p><p>He was standing at the podium for his news conference, fresh from rushing for 158 yards to set a team record for most yards in one season. He was visible only from the waist up in a tank-top-style shirt that displayed his weight-lifter biceps and his ballet dancer waist.</p><p>Martin was describing the elation of the Jets' finishing strong, punishing the Seattle Seahawks worse than yesterday's 19-9 score would suggest, righting their record at eight victories and eight losses.</p><p>Then a team official interrupted to announce that Oakland had just beaten Kansas City in overtime, 41-38, which meant that those very same Seahawks had qualified for the playoffs.</p><p>''They still get to go?'' Martin asked, apparently incredulous at the injustice of that.</p><p>Martin had obviously not spent the previous days poring over the multiple playoff scenarios for the National Football League, in which mediocrity goes unpunished and momentum means nothing.</p><p>This was the closest any Jet would come to admitting that there had been a malicious glee in humbling the Seahawks on a warm January afternoon. Martin conceded that while his five linemen were pushing the Seahawks all over the Meadowlands, he was carrying the football with mischief in his heart.</p><p>''At least we'll knock them out,'' Martin admitted he had thought.</p><p>It is not a dishonorable calling. The Jets had plenty of personal incentives on this final day. They bounced back from a horrendous 1-6 start, predicated by the injured Achilles' tendon suffered by Vinny Testaverde on Bill Parcells's chosen surface of artificial turf.</p><p>They won their last four games. They beat Miami. Big deal. Miami gets in the playoffs. They beat Dallas in Texas. So what? Dallas would beat the Giants yesterday and slip in. They beat Miami down there. Never mind. And yesterday they beat Seattle. Whatever.</p><p>Today the Jets clean out their lockers and Bill Parcells almost surely reveals his intention for next season.</p><p>The fans chanted ''One more year!'' and Parcells seemed vaguely on the verge of appearing to have one fleeting emotional quiver.</p><p>''This is a great place for me,'' he said afterward. ''I'm not trying to be nostalgic, but this is my home.''</p><p>Logic suggests that Parcells will not be leaving the Jets while they await somebody to buy the team from the estate of Leon Hess. But it is also clear that the Jets' resolute whacking of the Seahawks, as satisfying as it was, would not influence Parcells one way or the other.</p><p>''You know Bill,'' Martin said. ''My own opinion is, I'd say, 'Bill, you've got to stay here till my contract's up.' ''</p><p>For all his bullying, Parcells inspires a weird kind of football loyalty in a significant cadre of players.</p><p>Yesterday, no more than half an hour after Ray Lucas played yet another fine game at quarterback, Parcells referred to Lucas's ''wormy'' physique. Yet Lucas was pleased that at least the coach had not referred to him as Fats, as he has been known to do.</p><p>Martin and Lucas go back a ways with Parcells, to his previous job in New England. In 1995, Martin, just drafted from the University of Pittsburgh, gained 103 yards in his professional debut. The subsequent week, Parcells vociferously referred to Martin as a ''one-day wonder,'' and the taunting goes on to this day.</p><p>Some of the Parcells disciples even stay around to become mini-Parcells of their own. Maurice Carthon, the exemplary blocking back on Parcells's two Super Bowl championship teams with the Giants, is now an assistant with the Jets.</p><p>''Maurice knows how to push my buttons,'' Martin said. ''He's been telling me that if I didn't break the record today I might as well retire. He told me not to run out of bounds so much, that I should cut back inside, so that's what I tried to do today.''</p><p>Martin came into the game with 1,306 yards, only 25 behind the team record of Freeman McNeil in 1985. He took care of that early, with some elegant steps and brute power.</p><p>''I can't look because I'm too busy blocking the so-and-so on the other side of the line,'' said Randy Thomas, the left guard. ''But I know he did a great job.''</p><p>Kerry Jenkins, the right guard, said: ''Curtis makes it easy for us because of the way he fakes out the defense. We make our blocks, and we know where he's going.''</p><p>Martin finished with 1,464 yards, more yards than Matt Snell or Emerson Boozer or John Riggins or McNeil ever gained. He didn't talk much about the record because, he said, ''There's a saying that he who exalts himself will be humbled.''</p><p>The only people humbled yesterday were the Seahawks, and they get to play Miami next weekend.</p><p>''It's going to be tough to go home and watch,'' Martin admitted. ''We beat this team. We can beat that team. It's going to hurt.''</p></body></html>
