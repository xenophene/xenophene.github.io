<p><strong></strong>The all-American forward Svetlana Abrosimova led top-ranked Connecticut with 25 points as the Huskies continued their domination of college basketball's elite programs by handling No. 3 Louisiana Tech, 90-63, at Gampel Pavilion.</p><p>The Huskies ran off 16 consecutive points after surrendering the game's first basket, and took an 18-4 lead after six minutes.</p><p>Abrosimova and the junior guard Shea Ralph led the charge, scoring 20 of the Huskies' first 29 points.</p><p>''We played a great game tonight,'' Connecticut Coach Geno Auriemma said. ''I think we're pretty good right now, and we're only going to get better.''</p><p>Louisiana Tech tried to respond, scoring 8 straight points in the middle of the opening half to cut the Connecticut lead to 8 points, but the freshman point guard Kennitra Johnson, a reserve, scored 8 of her 10 points in a span of three minutes to douse the Lady Techsters' rally.</p><p>''They have the best team in the country right now, bar none,'' Louisiana Tech Coach Leon Barmore said.</p><p>Had it not been for Betty Lennox, one half of the Lady Techsters' backcourt, and her 14 first-half points, Louisiana Tech (10-2) would have been down at the half by far more than 47-30.</p><p>The Huskies (10-0) shot 55 percent in the first half, 66 percent (6 of 9) from 3-point range, while forcing 12 turnovers by the Lady Techsters.</p><p>Louisiana Tech managed only 31 percent shooting in the half and connected on only 3 of 12 attempts from 3-point range.</p><p>In the second half, the Huskies continued to outhustle and harass Louisiana Tech into its worst shooting performance of the season.</p><p>Louisiana Tech shot only 34 percent from the field for the game, including only 24 percent of its 3-point attempts.</p><p>The Lady Techsters also shot themselves in the foot at the free-throw line, connecting on only 20 percent (2 of 10) of their free throws.</p><p>As she had in her last game against top competition, a 106-64 annihilation of U.C.L.A., Abrosimova took over in the second half, leading four Huskies in double figures. The junior from Russia scored 15 points in the second half. Ralph converted on several breakaway lay-ups and finished with 15 points, 8 assists and 7 rebounds.</p><p>''Ever since my freshman year, I really haven't played that well in big games,'' Ralph said. ''But now we have the same approach to every game and I'm taking some of the pressure off myself.''</p><p>Lennox, an all-American candidate, finished with a game-high 27 points. Tamicha Jackson finished with 14 points.</p></body></html>
