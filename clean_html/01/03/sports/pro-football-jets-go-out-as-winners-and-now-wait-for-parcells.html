<p><strong></strong>The Jets went out in style today, all dressed up but with no place to go.</p><p>Their season ended in bittersweet fashion with a 19-9 victory over the Seattle Seahawks. The Jets' performance was good enough to bring them to .500 after a 1-6 start, good enough for a fourth straight victory behind quarterback Ray Lucas, good enough to be the seventh victory in their last nine games.</p><p>It just wasn't good enough to make the playoffs.</p><p>''The clock struck 12 for me, and it's time to go home,'' said Lucas, the self-styled Cinderella quarterback who began National Football League life as a special teams player, but who was buoyed by Coach Bill Parcells's belief that he could play a more glamorous role.</p><p>Obviously touched by the victory, Parcells said: ''We finally got out of the hole that we dug for ourselves. I'm really proud of those kids.''</p><p>But will all these recent positives be good enough to bring Parcells back next season? Will all those Meadowlands fans chanting ''One more year!'' in the final minutes do it?</p><p>Parcells said he would soon announce whether he would return next season, a decision that might be revealed as early as Monday.</p><p>''I'm going to think this over real quick,'' he said. Referring to the impending sale of the team, he added: ''We've got imminent changes here in the organization. I have a responsibility to the organization, and I will adhere to that responsibility. I'll do the best I can to get things squared away very quickly. Don't try to interpret what might happen. I have a few things to think over. I have to talk to some people.''</p><p>He said that in view of the impending announcement of a new owner for the team, which could come this month, he felt it was imperative to announce his own plans quickly. There is also the issue of his successor if he does step down. The assistant head coach Bill Belichick is being sought as a head coach by other clubs, although his contract calls for him to take over when Parcells retires.</p><p>One person on the team Parcells is close to said he believed the coach would return for a fourth season. But one of his assistants said, ''I don't think he knows yet.''</p><p>What is known is this: The Jets wound up feeling very good about themselves with still another victory over a playoff team. The Seahawks (9-7) made the playoffs in defeat, thanks to the Kansas City Chiefs' loss. The Jets' victory meant a playoff berth for the Miami Dolphins, who lost twice to the Jets last month.</p><p>As Lucas contemplated the playoffs starting without the Jets, he said: ''We're one of the hottest teams in football right now. It's a shame we're not in it.''</p><p>Despite throwing two interceptions, Lucas played an efficient game in which Curtis Martin was the key player. He rushed for a gaudy 158 yards on 34 carries, set a Jets single-season rushing record with 1,464 yards and scored the team's only touchdown.</p><p>John Hall produced the other points with 4-for-4 field-goal kicking, giving him a season-ending stretch of 11 field goals in his final 12 boots.</p><p>Martin had such a powerful opening half, when he produced 124 yards on only 19 carries, that the Seahawks could never generate momentum after their opening drives.</p><p>They took a quick lead on Todd Peterson's field goal. That was immediately matched by one from Hall, and then Peterson countered with another field goal. But on the following drive, Martin, behind stupendous blocking, produced a 50-yard run and capped the drive with a 1-yard scoring burst for a 10-6 lead. Hall went on to kick three more field goals, and all Seattle could produce for the rest of the game was a third Peterson field goal.</p><p>Jon Kitna was picked off twice by the aggressive Jets defense, including Marcus Coleman's team-leading sixth interception. In the second half the Jets' defense held Kitna to only 7 completions in 23 attempts. The Seahawks rushed for a mere 33 yards over all on 12 carries, with Ricky Watters having no run longer than 8 yards.</p><p>''They feel good about themselves,'' Parcells said of his players. ''I really think they played like champs the second half of the season. Not that that makes any difference because 8-8 is 8-8.'' Still, he said that the mark would impress itself on their memories, that ''this kind of evidence will carry over, that there's a way to come back from a big hole.''</p><p>''It's a building block for the team's future,'' wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson said. ''Not to be 7-9 is a positive.'' Johnson had his least productive game of the season, catching only 3 passes for 20 yards. Wayne Chrebet, who came on late in the season after being injured, was the game leader with 88 yards on 5 catches.</p><p>Lucas wound up with a 6-3 won-lost record, including 6-2 the second half of the season, after Parcells picked him to be the starting quarterback.</p><p>This theatrical ending has infused him with a confidence he did not exhibit in his early games as a starter. Emboldened by weekly victories over winning teams -- the Jets finished the season with the league's toughest schedule -- Lucas said: ''Now the thought in my mind is that there's no situation that can hurt our team. We're 8-8, and I was the quarterback.''</p><p>It was this big to Martin: ''If you'd been back in the locker room, you would have thought we'd won the Super Bowl.''</p><p>For Lucas, though, the carriage was waiting outside as the ball came to a close. ''It's kind of sad it's ending for me,'' he said. ''I'd like to play five more games.'' And then he fantasized, saying, ''Maybe one team will quit and we'll be in the playoffs.''</p><p>But it really was over. And now Parcells has to decide if it is for him, too.</p></body></html>
