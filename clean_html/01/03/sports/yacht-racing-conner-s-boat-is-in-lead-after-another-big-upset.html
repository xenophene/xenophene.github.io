<p><strong></strong>It was a day of frustration on the Hauraki Gulf; a day of broken equipment, torn sails cast into the rough sea and quick reversals of fortune that transformed favorites like America One into windswept losers in the America's Cup challenger semifinals.</p><p>Only one syndicate remained immune to it all, and it was not one of those that grabbed most of the headlines and sponsors in the early rounds of this cutthroat but hardly cut-rate competition.</p><p>After two days of racing, the only undefeated syndicate is Stars and Stripes. That will come as no surprise to those inside and outside the sport who are familiar with its skipper, Dennis Conner, but it comes as a big surprise to those who watched Conner's only boat struggle to a 5-5 record in the third round-robin round before Christmas.</p><p>Today's victim was the Prada Challenge, the strong Italian syndicate that has the biggest budget of the six semifinalists and had looked very sleek and fast and composed on Sunday in a convincing victory over America True. But today, against a more experienced group of Americans, the Italians were outclassed.</p><p>Conner's crew, again sailing without him on board, was more sure-handed: striking the proper balance between conservatism and aggression. The crew controlled the start, claiming the left side that has been the preferred side in the early going here, and it proceeded to control every mark that followed, losing ground only on the first leeward leg to the Italian boat, Luna Rossa.</p><p>But after that turn, the Italians fell back. Their surge had failed and their equipment was failing, too. They sailed the remainder of the race with a damaged boomvang, the support pole which is used to keep the boom low heading downwind. And they were soon wrapping duct tape around it: a low-tech response to a high-tech problem.</p><p>With the wind gusting up to 26 knots on course readings and as high as 35 knots on one gauge high on Stars and Stripes' mast (''Just like the Caribbean,'' cracked the crew member Peter Holmberg), the Americans increased their lead to 26 seconds at the third mark, where the Italians' spinnaker work paled in comparison with theirs. They then expanded the lead to 37 seconds at the fourth mark and to 1 minute 7 seconds by the finish.</p><p>It was Stars and Stripes' second straight victory over a favored challenger. On Sunday, it had beaten Nippon Challenge by nearly a minute in its opening semifinal race.</p><p>''I think the Nippon race was over in the first 10 minutes, and we were the ones who got the benefit of those first 10 minutes, but after that I didn't see much difference in boat speed,'' the Stars and Stripes tactician Tom Whidden said.</p><p>''However I must say I liked what I saw today. Even though it was a little bit shifty and hard to get a read on how fast the boats were going.''</p><p>Nippon managed to shrug off mechanical problems of its own and a surge from Le Defi Francais on the second leeward leg to win by 38 seconds today. But the most star-crossed race of this afternoon was between America One and its hometown rival America True.</p><p>Both syndicates are based in San Francisco: America One at the St. Francis Yacht Club and America True at the San Francisco Yacht Club.</p><p>And though America One has two boats, better funding and more celebrated sailors, particularly the skipper Paul Cayard, it has now lost three of its four races against Dawn Riley's single-boat syndicate.</p><p>Midway through the second leeward leg, it appeared that it would be Cayard's day when America True's spinnaker ripped in half. It then got caught under the boat, where the spinnaker sheets wrapped around the keel. Frantic, the crew managed to cut free the sail that had become a brake, but when it reached the fourth mark, it was trailing by 1:05.</p><p>But America One would soon have more serious problems. Shortly after rounding the mark, its jib halyard broke and the jib tore free from the headsail track in the gusting wind.</p><p>This time, Cayard's crew was the one dumping a sail into the water, and the damage would keep America One from flying a jib on its new boat, USA-61, for the rest of the leg: a handicap that one observer likened to boxing with just one hand.</p><p>By the final windward mark, its one-minute lead had become a 2:49 deficit, and though America True was hardly at its best on the last leg because of its spinnaker problems, it was good enough to beat its more damaged rival by 2:23.</p><p>''I think the losses are extremely critical,'' a visibly irritated Cayard said, all too aware that only two semifinalists will advance out of this round. ''Good points were that the boat was going real well and we have eight races left.''</p><p>Both San Francisco-based boats are now 1-1, as are Prada and Nippon. The only syndicate without a victory is Le Defi Francais, which is considered stronger in lighter winds than the heavy winds that buffeted today's racing.</p><p>Stars and Stripes thrives on heavy weather, and for experienced Conner crew members like Whidden, it brings back pleasant memories of another Southern Hemisphere locale: the windy waters off of Fremantle, Australia, where Conner won back the America's Cup from the Australians in 1987.</p><p>''I think our Fremantle experience probably helped us here, and you realize some of the things you have to do to handle the storm breeze,'' Whidden said. ''Having started our program a little bit late, we decided to make our boat a little more bulletproof.''</p><p>''I think we've got a strong mast and a strong boat,'' he added, expressing confidence in the modifications Stars and Stripes made before this round. ''We may not have the lightest gear out there, but we're pretty confident we're not going to break down.''</p></body></html>
