<p><strong></strong>They aren't on the field that much, maybe a combined total of two minutes. When they trot on, it usually means television is coming out of or going into a commercial break.</p><p>Watch carefully, however, when the special teams of Virginia Tech and Florida State get their turns in the Sugar Bowl. Their coaches say that how each team punts, place-kicks and covers kicks might decide the national title.</p><p>''You're going to have two teams playing with two of the best special teams in the country -- I'm talking kickers, blockers and returners, and it'll play a role in this game,'' Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden said.</p><p>Virginia Tech Coach Frank Beamer, who is his own special teams coach, is even more emphatic. In his 13 seasons at Virginia Tech, his Hokies have blocked 75 kicks -- including a nation's-best 63 in the 1990's -- and combined with the defense for 57 touchdowns.</p><p>''The quickest way to win games is with special teams,'' Beamer said.</p><p>Even before the two 11-0 teams meet Tuesday night, members of their teams have made news, though not exactly the kind Bowden and Beamer welcome.</p><p>Florida State's two-time all-American kicker Sebastian Janikowski announced this weekend he would skip his senior year to enter the National Football League draft. Janikowski had to run extra wind sprints Saturday and spend all of Saturday night in his hotel room for missing curfew New Year's Eve. But Bowden said, ''When they put the ball out there, he's going to kick it.''</p><p>Reggie Durden, a Seminole defensive back, also ran extra sprints for missing curfew.</p><p>Beamer has had his hands full replacing punt returner Ricky Hall, who broke a bone in his left foot during practice Friday, as well as trying to calm his unusually manic all-American, Corey Moore. The senior defensive end, who has four career blocks, has alternately guaranteed a Hokie victory over the top-ranked Seminoles and ridiculed reporters' questions before storming out of media-day interviews.</p><p>Both coaches blame too much pregame hype and hotel confinement for the incidents and have indicated the special teams will be at full strength. Break down this decidedly nonglamorous aspect of the game and it is yet another example of how closely the two teams are matched.</p><p>In Janikowski, Florida State has a left-footer who booms kickoffs out of the end zone, has converted 23 of 30 field goals and all 47 extra points, and will probably be an N.F.L. first-round pick.</p><p>The Polish-born, 6-foot-2-inch, 255-pounder also has a penchant for long nights of cold beer and shooting pool.</p><p>Deep snapper Clay Ingram said: ''A lot of stuff about him going out and staying out all night and still coming in and kicking 50-yard field goals, that's all true. That's the way he is. The legend is real.</p><p>''For a lot of us, our idea of relaxing is going home and watching TV. He'll stay in a bar until 3 o'clock in the morning shooting pool and drinking, and that's relaxing to him.''</p><p>Last year before Florida State's national title game with Tennessee, Janikowski confessed that he dreaded the idea of having to boot the game-winning kick. He never got that chance against the Vols. Now, he says he is looking forward to the opportunity and predicted he would have a range of up to 68 yards inside the Superdome. And the Hokies' reputation as kick blockers doesn't intimidate him. ''I really don't think much about it, and I don't watch much film on it, either,'' he said.</p><p>Virginia Tech counters with Shayne Graham, who is the only player in Big East history, except for the former Syracuse quarterback Donovan McNabb, to be named first team all-conference four consecutive years. He has 371 career points, including 107 this season. He has hit from 53 yards and was 17 of 22 in field-goal attempts this season.</p><p>None was bigger, however, than a 44-yard kick in the closing seconds to beat West Virginia, 22-20, and keep the Hokies' title hopes alive. ''I love my chances with Shayne Graham,'' the Hokies' star quarterback Michael Vick said.</p><p>Florida State appears to have the advantage now that Virginia Tech's punt returner, Hall, is out. The senior, who is also the team's second-leading receiver, averaged 12.8 yards a return with a touchdown. He will be replaced by the junior Ike Charlton, a starting cornerback, who has not fielded any punts this season. Still, the Hokies' block-kick rush gives Charlton confidence.</p><p>''We're going to go after the punter anyway, so we're going to mix it up between setting up the returns and trying to block the punt,'' he said.</p><p>For the Seminoles, a punt is another opportunity for Peter Warrick to break open the game. He returned 18 punts an average of 12.6 yards with a touchdown this season. In Jimmy Kibble, however, the Hokies may have an accurate enough leg to keep the ball away from Warrick.</p><p>Kibble was named first-team Big East for the third year in a row and had only 9 of his 46 punts returned, for a total of 36 yards. He has punted the ball inside the 20-yard line 16 times. Bowden and Beamer are impressed with each other's preparation in one of the most detailed facets of football. The difference may be the will of individual players in those handful of plays, Bowden said.</p><p>''We all work as hard as we can to prepare on special teams,'' he said. ''But it still comes down to some individual going above and beyond the call of duty and making a play that could win a game.''</p></body></html>
